Title: GPT-5 is coming it's codename: Gobi
Content: OpenAI is reportedly accelerating efforts to release an advanced multimodal LLM called GPT-Vision, codenamed **Gobi.**  ([Source](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-hustles-to-beat-google-to-launch-multimodal-llm))

**The Promise of Multimodal AI**

* ***Processes Text and Images:*** Multimodal LLMs can understand and generate content combining text and images, offering expanded capabilities.
* **GPT-Vision is stuck in safety reviews:** but “OpenAI’s engineers seem close to satisfying legal concerns.”
* ***Key Edge Over Rivals***: Launching first with multimodal abilities could give OpenAI a critical advantage over competitors.

**OpenAI's Reported Rush to Release Gobi**

* ***Aiming to Beat Google:*** OpenAI seems intent on launching Gobi before Google can debut [Gemini](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-nears-release-of-gemini-ai-to-rival-openai) to dominate the multimodal space.
* **Expanding GPT-4's Abilities:** Gobi may build on GPT-4 by adding enhanced visual and multimodal features that OpenAI previewed earlier.
* ***The Enduring Nature of Progress***: Both firms recognize the long-term, competitive nature of AI advancement.

**TL;DR:** OpenAI looks to stay ahead of Google in the AI race by rushing to launch an advanced multimodal LLM before Google's Gemini, a preemptive move that could disrupt Google's plans and ambitions.

Title: Some universities are ditching AI detection software amid fears students could be falsely accused of cheating by using ChatGPT
Content: Major universities have discontinued the use of AI detection tools due to concerns about their accuracy, potentially falsely accusing students of cheating with the aid of AI tools like ChatGPT.

If you want to stay ahead of the curve in AI and tech, [look here first](https://dupple.com/techpresso?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=post).

**AI Detection Tool Concerns**

* **False Accusations of Cheating**: Many universities, including Vanderbilt and Northwestern, have stopped using Turnitin's AI detection tools over worries they might wrongly accuse students of using AI to write essays.
* **High False Positive Rate**: Vanderbilt University highlighted a 1% false positive rate, potentially mislabeling 750 out of 75,000 papers. Similarly, Northwestern University and the University of Texas expressed accuracy concerns, opting not to use the tool.

**ChatGPT's Rise & Challenges**

* **Popularity Among Students**: The growing use of ChatGPT by students has educators worried about a surge in academic dishonesty.
* **Misidentification Issues**: A Texas professor mistakenly failed half his class because of false detections by ChatGPT, while other students faced wrongful accusations by anti-plagiarism software.

**OpenAI's Stance**

* **Difficulty in AI Text Detection**: OpenAI abandoned its AI text detector due to its low accuracy rate. They've also cautioned educators about the unreliability of AI content detectors.
* **Bias Against Non-English Writers**: Many detection tools wrongly labeled content by non-English writers as AI-generated, causing additional concerns.
