Title: Microsoft’s Copilot puts AI into everything, YouTube announces 3 new AI features for creators, 4 Crucial Factors for Evaluating LLMs in Industry Applications, AI Detection Tool Concerns, Amazon brings Generative AI to Alexa and Fire TV, DALL·E 3
Content: [https://youtu.be/qe5tBvkvrf8](https://youtu.be/qe5tBvkvrf8)

# Summary:

# Microsoft’s Copilot puts AI into everything

Microsoft has announced a new AI-powered feature, Microsoft Copilot. It’ll bring AI features into various Windows 11, Microsoft 365, Edge, and Bing. Our first impressions are that it’s Bing but for Windows. You can use Copilot to rearrange windows, generate text, open apps on the web, edit pictures and more.Copilot can be accessed via an app or with a simple right-click and will be rolled out across Bing, Edge, and Microsoft 365 this fall, with the free Windows 11 update starting on September 26th.Why does this matter?While we don’t see any revolutionary use cases of Copilot as of now, it’s still a huge step towards the democratization of AI. As more users get their hands on this AI copilot, we’ll know the true extent of its effectiveness. If all goes well, Microsoft will end up grabbing an even bigger share of the AI market as it will deliver AI natively to all Windows devices.

# YouTube announces 3 new AI features for creators

In a YouTube event, the company announced 3 AI-powered features for YouTube Shorts creators.

**Dream Screen**: It allows users to create image or video backgrounds using AI. All you need to do is type what you want to see in the background and AI will create it for you.

**Creator Music**: This was a previously available feature but got an AI revamp this time around. Creators can simply type in the kind and length of the music they need and AI will find the most relevant suggestions for their needs.

**AI Insights for Creators:** This is an inspiration tool which generates video ideas based on AI’s analysis of what the audiences are already watching and prefer.Why does this matter?It seems like a strategic decision to natively introduce AI features to support users. It’s a trend we are seeing increasingly more across the landscape. For the users, it's great news since they get free AI assistance in their creative endeavors.

# Google’s innovative approach to train smaller language models

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled new capabilities in few-shot learning, but their massive size makes deployment challenging. To address this, the authors propose a new method called distilling step-by-step, which trains smaller task-specific models using less data while surpassing LLM performance.First, the key idea is to extract rationales - intermediate reasoning steps - from an LLM using few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. These rationales are then used alongside labels to train smaller models in a multi-task framework, with tasks for label prediction and rationale generation. Experiments across NLI, QA, and math datasets show this approach reduces training data needs by 75-80% compared to standard fine-tuning.Why does this matter?This new approach to train smaller models with higher accuracy has the potential to support language models that can be deployed on local devices while retaining the performance that was previously achievable only through LLMs.

# 4 Crucial Factors for Evaluating Large Language Models in Industry Applications

Based on your end goal, you might fancy one LLM over the other. For instance, some industries value privacy over anything while others might put data accuracy over everything else. In this article, Skanda Vivek shares the 4 critical factors you should always consider when picking a large language model.He mentions Quality, Economic, Latency, and Privacy to be the 4 resting pillars of your decision. He then goes into details discussing each of these parameters and how you should evaluate a given model against them.Why does this matter?The ability to make the right decision when choosing the underlying LLM for your applications is massively important. This article will provide you with valuable insights when it comes to choosing the right LLM.

# DeepMind’s new AI can predict genetic diseases

Google DeepMind’s new system, called AlphaMissense, can tell if the letters in the DNA will produce the correct shape. If not, it is listed as potentially disease-causing.AlphaMissense can predict the likelihood of genetic diseases by analyzing genetic mutations called missense variants.AlphaMissense operates like a large language model, trained on human and primate biology, capable of identifying normal sequences of proteins and detecting changes that could suggest a disease.With 90% accuracy, AlphaMissense is more reliable than existing tools, potentially accelerating the process of identifying disease-causing genetic mutations, which previously required months of meticulous research.

Currently, genetic disease hunters have fairly limited knowledge of which areas of human DNA can lead to disease and have to search across billions of chemical building blocks that make up DNA. They have classified 0.1% of letter changes, or mutations, as either benign or disease-causing. DeepMind's new model pushed that percentage up to 89%.Why does this matter?AI is changing nearly everything we do at the moment and might revolutionize molecular biology and life sciences, too. This development is expected to speed up diagnosis and help search for better genetic disease treatments.

# Google is turning its Bard AI chatbot into a personal assistant

  
Google's Bard AI now has enhanced capabilities, pulling real-time data from Google's other applications and a user's data silo to deliver more relevant chatbot responses.  
A new feature named Bard Extensions allows the AI to access user's personal Google data to provide specific answers about their daily activities, while promising not to be used for ad targeting or training the AI model.  
To increase transparency and accuracy, Google is introducing a 'Double Check' feature where Bard audits its responses and highlights contradictory or heavily referenced statements.

# DeepMind’s New AI Can Predict Genetic Diseases

AlphaMissense, a new model from Google’s artificial intelligence team, analyzes the effects of DNA mutations and will accelerate research into rare diseases.  
About 10 years ago, Žiga Avsec was a PhD physics student who found himself taking a crash course in genomics via a university module on machine learning. He was soon working in a lab that studied rare diseases, on a project aiming to pin down the exact genetic mutation that caused an unusual mitochondrial disease.  
This was, Avsec says, a “needle in a haystack” problem. There were millions of potential culprits lurking in the genetic code—DNA mutations that could wreak havoc on a person’s biology. Of particular interest were so-called missense variants: single-letter changes to genetic code that result in a different amino acid being made within a protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and proteins are the building blocks of everything else in the body, so even small changes can have large and far-reaching effects.

So, if you're looking for some inspiration, AI has got your back. This move by YouTube seems like a smart strategic decision to integrate AI features directly into the platform.

When it comes to evaluating large language models (LLMs) for industry applications, there are four crucial factors to consider. Skanda Vivek highlights these factors, which include quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy. Each of these factors plays a significant role in determining the suitability of a particular LLM. The quality of the LLM is of utmost importance. Depending on your end goal, you may prioritize different aspects of quality, such as data accuracy, contextual understanding, or fluency. Consider what matters most to your industry and choose an LLM that aligns with those preferences. Economic factors also come into play. It's essential to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a particular LLM. Does it provide value for money? Can it fit within your organization's budget? Analyzing the economic aspects ensures you make an informed decision. Latency, or the response time of the LLM, is another vital factor. Some applications require real-time or near-instantaneous responses. Evaluating an LLM's latency helps you select the model that meets your specific timing requirements. Finally, privacy is increasingly significant for many industries. Skanda Vivek emphasizes the need to consider privacy when choosing an LLM. Depending on your industry, data security and privacy regulations may be a top priority. Ensuring the chosen model aligns with your privacy needs is crucial. Choosing the right LLM is a critical decision that can significantly impact your applications. By carefully considering these four factors—quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy—you can make an informed choice that aligns with your industry's requirements. In recent news, some universities are raising concerns about AI detection software used to catch cheating students. There are worries that students could be falsely accused of cheating when using tools like ChatGPT. As a result, some universities are opting to abandon these AI detection systems. The debate highlights the potential drawbacks and risks associated with relying entirely on AI tools for academic integrity.So, here's the thing. Some major universities have decided to ditch AI detection tools because they're worried about their accuracy. And let's face it, nobody wants to be falsely accused of cheating, right? One tool in particular, called ChatGPT, has caused quite a stir. The problem with ChatGPT is that it's gained popularity among students, and that's got educators really concerned about academic dishonesty. But it's not just about students using AI to write their essays. It's also about the tool itself misidentifying things and getting it all wrong. For example, one professor in Texas failed half of his class because of false detections by ChatGPT. Can you imagine? Talk about a nightmare scenario. And it's not just him. Other students have also been wrongly accused by anti-plagiarism software using ChatGPT. What's interesting is that even OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has abandoned their own AI text detector due to its low accuracy rate. They've even warned educators about relying too heavily on AI content detectors. And here's another thing to consider: these detection tools often get it wrong when it comes to content written by non-English writers. So, yeah, there are some serious concerns here. That's why some universities, like Vanderbilt and Northwestern, have decided to say "no thanks" to these AI detection tools. It's better to be safe than sorry, right? After all, nobody wants to unfairly accuse a student of cheating.Hey there! Some interesting news for you today. According to Climate Action Against Disinformation, X, which we all know as Twitter, has ranked last when it comes to tackling climate misinformation. Quite the bummer, right? It turns out that Pinterest is leading the pack in addressing climate change misinformation, with YouTube, Meta (formerly known as Facebook), and Instagram not too far behind. But poor old X is lagging behind. So, what led to this low ranking for X? Well, it seems that since Elon Musk took over, things have changed, and not for the better. There are unclear policies on climate misinformation and a less communicative content moderation team, both of which have contributed to X's downward slide in the rankings. Maybe they need to step up their game a bit. In another news story, Google is facing a lawsuit after it allegedly directed a man, Philip Paxson, to drive off a collapsed bridge via Google Maps. Sadly, Paxson lost his life in the tragic accident. According to his family, Google was aware of the bridge's collapse but failed to update its navigation system, which they argue makes the tech giant negligent in Paxson's death. Google apparently received reports about the bridge's condition, but did nothing to fix the route information. It's a heartbreaking situation. And finally, brace yourself for this one. A study by dappGambl has found that a whopping 95% of NFTs are now practically worthless. Yep, you heard that right. NFTs, which were once all the rage, have lost their shine. Prices have plummeted, and most of the 73,257 NFT collections analyzed have a market cap of zero Ether. It's uncertain what the future holds for NFTs, but they'll need to prove their worth, whether through cultural significance or as a representation of actual art, if they want to stick around. So, that's the latest in tech and climate news. Stay tuned for more updates!OpenAI has just unveiled their latest model for text-to-image translation called DALL·E 3, and it's pretty impressive! This new version is built directly on ChatGPT, which means you can use ChatGPT to generate customized and detailed prompts for DALL·E 3. And if the results aren't exactly what you were hoping for, you can even ask ChatGPT to make some tweaks. Compared to its predecessor, DALL·E 2, DALL·E 3 delivers significant improvements in creating detailed images. OpenAI showcased this by providing a prompt for an expressive oil painting of a basketball player dunking, depicted as an explosion of a nebula. The results from DALL·E 3 were far superior to those from DALL·E 2. OpenAI has also taken steps to ensure that DALL·E 3 doesn't generate violent, adult, or hateful content. They have designed it to decline requests for images in the style of living artists. Additionally, creators have the option to exclude their images from being used in the training of OpenAI's future image generation models, giving them more control over the use of their work. Currently, DALL·E 3 is in research preview and will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in October through the API. It will later be made available in Labs for those interested. This new release is important because it addresses the limitations of previous text-to-image systems, which often ignored certain words or descriptions. With DALL·E 3, AI's ability to generate images that align precisely with the provided text takes a huge leap forward. It raises questions about how other image generators like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion will keep up. OpenAI has also prioritized safety improvements in DALL·E 3. They have implemented measures to prevent explicit content and have tools in place to identify risky words and block public figures. Furthermore, artists can now request that their work be blocked from AI copying, and DALL·E 3 won't mimic the styles of specific artists when named. OpenAI hopes that the integration with ChatGPT and the safety guards in DALL·E 3 will expand access to this technology while preventing misuse. However, there are still concerns and legal issues surrounding AI-generated art that need to be addressed.Amazon had some exciting announcements at its recent devices event. One of the standout updates is the integration of generative AI into their Echo family of devices. This new AI model is optimized for voice, taking into account not only what is said but also body language, eye contact, and gestures. This means that interactions with Alexa will become much more powerful and conversational, providing users with improved experiences. But that's not all. Amazon has also introduced generative AI updates for Fire TV's voice search. This update aims to enhance the conversational interaction between users and Alexa, allowing for a more natural and intuitive way to discover new content based on specific preferences. This development is significant because it showcases how integrating language models like Generative AI into voice assistants can revolutionize the way we interact with them. Amazon's revamp of Alexa using generative AI is a game-changer. It enables voice assistants to better understand context, seamlessly carry over information from previous conversations, and provide a more personalized experience for users. In fact, Amazon is transforming Alexa into a hands-free ChatGPT by leveraging the technology behind chatbots. This upgrade will give Alexa the ability to engage in more complex and open-ended conversations. It will also enhance its simulated personality, interpret body language (for devices with cameras), and modulate its voice for a more natural conversation. However, there are some challenges to overcome, such as responding accurately to body language and refining these large language models to prevent inappropriate or nonsensical responses. But with Amazon's dedication to improving AI experiences, we can expect significant advancements in these areas. Overall, Amazon's integration of generative AI into Alexa and Fire TV demonstrates their commitment to providing users with more intuitive, personalized, and conversational experiences.Hey there! Have you heard about Mark Zuckerberg's latest philanthropy project? It's got a pretty ambitious goal - to "cure all diseases".

So here's the plan: CZI is planning to build one of the biggest GPU clusters in the world specifically for AI-driven biomedical research. They want to use large language models to dive deep into disease development at the cellular level and even predict how cells behave. And to do that, they're going to need some serious computational power - over 1,000 Nvidia's H100 GPUs! This high-performance computing system is expected to be up and running by 2024. And let me tell you, it's going to revolutionize biomedical research. From mapping out various cell types across different organisms to designing potential drugs and therapeutics, this GPU cluster will supercharge the entire process. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty excited to see what kind of breakthroughs this project will bring. Who knows, maybe we'll be living in a world where diseases are a thing of the past sooner than we think!So, let's dive into the latest AI updates from OpenAI, Microsoft, YouTube, Google, Cisco, and Anthropic. It seems like ChatGPT is back in the spotlight with an increase in usage, particularly because students are returning to school and concerns about AI cheating are on the rise. After experiencing a decline throughout the summer, ChatGPT has seen a 12% traffic increase since fall classes resumed in the US. However, it's important to note that current usage is still below the peak levels seen earlier this year. With students back in the classroom, concerns about AI-aided cheating have resurfaced. The easier access students have to AI technology raises fresh debates among schools about whether to ban, incorporate, or ignore such tools. For educators, managing responsible AI use in academics is becoming a complex balancing act. There's also some uncertainty surrounding potential revenue as ChatGPT's reliance on students could pose challenges for monetization. Moving on to other AI news, Microsoft has announced a new AI-powered feature called Microsoft Copilot. This feature, available in various Windows 11 applications, Microsoft 365, Edge, and Bing, allows users to rearrange windows, generate text, edit pictures, and more.

# Google’s innovative approach to train smaller language models

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled new capabilities in few-shot learning, but their massive size makes deployment challenging. To address this, the authors propose a new method called distilling step-by-step, which trains smaller task-specific models using less data while surpassing LLM performance.First, the key idea is to extract rationales - intermediate reasoning steps - from an LLM using few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. These rationales are then used alongside labels to train smaller models in a multi-task framework, with tasks for label prediction and rationale generation. Experiments across NLI, QA, and math datasets show this approach reduces training data needs by 75-80% compared to standard fine-tuning.Why does this matter?This new approach to train smaller models with higher accuracy has the potential to support language models that can be deployed on local devices while retaining the performance that was previously achievable only through LLMs.

# 4 Crucial Factors for Evaluating Large Language Models in Industry Applications

Based on your end goal, you might fancy one LLM over the other. For instance, some industries value privacy over anything while others might put data accuracy over everything else. In this article, Skanda Vivek shares the 4 critical factors you should always consider when picking a large language model.He mentions Quality, Economic, Latency, and Privacy to be the 4 resting pillars of your decision. He then goes into details discussing each of these parameters and how you should evaluate a given model against them.Why does this matter?The ability to make the right decision when choosing the underlying LLM for your applications is massively important. This article will provide you with valuable insights when it comes to choosing the right LLM.

# DeepMind’s new AI can predict genetic diseases

Google DeepMind’s new system, called AlphaMissense, can tell if the letters in the DNA will produce the correct shape. If not, it is listed as potentially disease-causing.AlphaMissense can predict the likelihood of genetic diseases by analyzing genetic mutations called missense variants.AlphaMissense operates like a large language model, trained on human and primate biology, capable of identifying normal sequences of proteins and detecting changes that could suggest a disease.With 90% accuracy, AlphaMissense is more reliable than existing tools, potentially accelerating the process of identifying disease-causing genetic mutations, which previously required months of meticulous research.

Currently, genetic disease hunters have fairly limited knowledge of which areas of human DNA can lead to disease and have to search across billions of chemical building blocks that make up DNA. They have classified 0.1% of letter changes, or mutations, as either benign or disease-causing. DeepMind's new model pushed that percentage up to 89%.Why does this matter?AI is changing nearly everything we do at the moment and might revolutionize molecular biology and life sciences, too. This development is expected to speed up diagnosis and help search for better genetic disease treatments.

# Google is turning its Bard AI chatbot into a personal assistant

  
Google's Bard AI now has enhanced capabilities, pulling real-time data from Google's other applications and a user's data silo to deliver more relevant chatbot responses.  
A new feature named Bard Extensions allows the AI to access user's personal Google data to provide specific answers about their daily activities, while promising not to be used for ad targeting or training the AI model.  
To increase transparency and accuracy, Google is introducing a 'Double Check' feature where Bard audits its responses and highlights contradictory or heavily referenced statements.

&#x200B;

# DeepMind’s New AI Can Predict Genetic Diseases

AlphaMissense, a new model from Google’s artificial intelligence team, analyzes the effects of DNA mutations and will accelerate research into rare diseases.  
About 10 years ago, Žiga Avsec was a PhD physics student who found himself taking a crash course in genomics via a university module on machine learning. He was soon working in a lab that studied rare diseases, on a project aiming to pin down the exact genetic mutation that caused an unusual mitochondrial disease.  
This was, Avsec says, a “needle in a haystack” problem. There were millions of potential culprits lurking in the genetic code—DNA mutations that could wreak havoc on a person’s biology. Of particular interest were so-called missense variants: single-letter changes to genetic code that result in a different amino acid being made within a protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and proteins are the building blocks of everything else in the body, so even small changes can have large and far-reaching effects.

So, if you're looking for some inspiration, AI has got your back. This move by YouTube seems like a smart strategic decision to integrate AI features directly into the platform.

When it comes to evaluating large language models (LLMs) for industry applications, there are four crucial factors to consider. Skanda Vivek highlights these factors, which include quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy. Each of these factors plays a significant role in determining the suitability of a particular LLM. The quality of the LLM is of utmost importance. Depending on your end goal, you may prioritize different aspects of quality, such as data accuracy, contextual understanding, or fluency. Consider what matters most to your industry and choose an LLM that aligns with those preferences. Economic factors also come into play. It's essential to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a particular LLM. Does it provide value for money? Can it fit within your organization's budget? Analyzing the economic aspects ensures you make an informed decision. Latency, or the response time of the LLM, is another vital factor. Some applications require real-time or near-instantaneous responses. Evaluating an LLM's latency helps you select the model that meets your specific timing requirements. Finally, privacy is increasingly significant for many industries. Skanda Vivek emphasizes the need to consider privacy when choosing an LLM. Depending on your industry, data security and privacy regulations may be a top priority. Ensuring the chosen model aligns with your privacy needs is crucial. Choosing the right LLM is a critical decision that can significantly impact your applications. By carefully considering these four factors—quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy—you can make an informed choice that aligns with your industry's requirements. In recent news, some universities are raising concerns about AI detection software used to catch cheating students. There are worries that students could be falsely accused of cheating when using tools like ChatGPT. As a result, some universities are opting to abandon these AI detection systems. The debate highlights the potential drawbacks and risks associated with relying entirely on AI tools for academic integrity.So, here's the thing. Some major universities have decided to ditch AI detection tools because they're worried about their accuracy. And let's face it, nobody wants to be falsely accused of cheating, right? One tool in particular, called ChatGPT, has caused quite a stir. The problem with ChatGPT is that it's gained popularity among students, and that's got educators really concerned about academic dishonesty. But it's not just about students using AI to write their essays. It's also about the tool itself misidentifying things and getting it all wrong. For example, one professor in Texas failed half of his class because of false detections by ChatGPT. Can you imagine? Talk about a nightmare scenario. And it's not just him. Other students have also been wrongly accused by anti-plagiarism software using ChatGPT. What's interesting is that even OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has abandoned their own AI text detector due to its low accuracy rate. They've even warned educators about relying too heavily on AI content detectors. And here's another thing to consider: these detection tools often get it wrong when it comes to content written by non-English writers. So, yeah, there are some serious concerns here. That's why some universities, like Vanderbilt and Northwestern, have decided to say "no thanks" to these AI detection tools. It's better to be safe than sorry, right? After all, nobody wants to unfairly accuse a student of cheating.Hey there! Some interesting news for you today. According to Climate Action Against Disinformation, X, which we all know as Twitter, has ranked last when it comes to tackling climate misinformation. Quite the bummer, right? It turns out that Pinterest is leading the pack in addressing climate change misinformation, with YouTube, Meta (formerly known as Facebook), and Instagram not too far behind. But poor old X is lagging behind. So, what led to this low ranking for X? Well, it seems that since Elon Musk took over, things have changed, and not for the better. There are unclear policies on climate misinformation and a less communicative content moderation team, both of which have contributed to X's downward slide in the rankings. Maybe they need to step up their game a bit. In another news story, Google is facing a lawsuit after it allegedly directed a man, Philip Paxson, to drive off a collapsed bridge via Google Maps. Sadly, Paxson lost his life in the tragic accident. According to his family, Google was aware of the bridge's collapse but failed to update its navigation system, which they argue makes the tech giant negligent in Paxson's death. Google apparently received reports about the bridge's condition, but did nothing to fix the route information. It's a heartbreaking situation. And finally, brace yourself for this one. A study by dappGambl has found that a whopping 95% of NFTs are now practically worthless. Yep, you heard that right. NFTs, which were once all the rage, have lost their shine. Prices have plummeted, and most of the 73,257 NFT collections analyzed have a market cap of zero Ether. It's uncertain what the future holds for NFTs, but they'll need to prove their worth, whether through cultural significance or as a representation of actual art, if they want to stick around. So, that's the latest in tech and climate news. Stay tuned for more updates!OpenAI has just unveiled their latest model for text-to-image translation called DALL·E 3, and it's pretty impressive! This new version is built directly on ChatGPT, which means you can use ChatGPT to generate customized and detailed prompts for DALL·E 3. And if the results aren't exactly what you were hoping for, you can even ask ChatGPT to make some tweaks. Compared to its predecessor, DALL·E 2, DALL·E 3 delivers significant improvements in creating detailed images. OpenAI showcased this by providing a prompt for an expressive oil painting of a basketball player dunking, depicted as an explosion of a nebula. The results from DALL·E 3 were far superior to those from DALL·E 2. OpenAI has also taken steps to ensure that DALL·E 3 doesn't generate violent, adult, or hateful content. They have designed it to decline requests for images in the style of living artists. Additionally, creators have the option to exclude their images from being used in the training of OpenAI's future image generation models, giving them more control over the use of their work. Currently, DALL·E 3 is in research preview and will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in October through the API. It will later be made available in Labs for those interested. This new release is important because it addresses the limitations of previous text-to-image systems, which often ignored certain words or descriptions. With DALL·E 3, AI's ability to generate images that align precisely with the provided text takes a huge leap forward. It raises questions about how other image generators like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion will keep up. OpenAI has also prioritized safety improvements in DALL·E 3. They have implemented measures to prevent explicit content and have tools in place to identify risky words and block public figures. Furthermore, artists can now request that their work be blocked from AI copying, and DALL·E 3 won't mimic the styles of specific artists when named. OpenAI hopes that the integration with ChatGPT and the safety guards in DALL·E 3 will expand access to this technology while preventing misuse. However, there are still concerns and legal issues surrounding AI-generated art that need to be addressed.Amazon had some exciting announcements at its recent devices event. One of the standout updates is the integration of generative AI into their Echo family of devices. This new AI model is optimized for voice, taking into account not only what is said but also body language, eye contact, and gestures. This means that interactions with Alexa will become much more powerful and conversational, providing users with improved experiences. But that's not all. Amazon has also introduced generative AI updates for Fire TV's voice search. This update aims to enhance the conversational interaction between users and Alexa, allowing for a more natural and intuitive way to discover new content based on specific preferences. This development is significant because it showcases how integrating language models like Generative AI into voice assistants can revolutionize the way we interact with them. Amazon's revamp of Alexa using generative AI is a game-changer. It enables voice assistants to better understand context, seamlessly carry over information from previous conversations, and provide a more personalized experience for users. In fact, Amazon is transforming Alexa into a hands-free ChatGPT by leveraging the technology behind chatbots. This upgrade will give Alexa the ability to engage in more complex and open-ended conversations. It will also enhance its simulated personality, interpret body language (for devices with cameras), and modulate its voice for a more natural conversation. However, there are some challenges to overcome, such as responding accurately to body language and refining these large language models to prevent inappropriate or nonsensical responses. But with Amazon's dedication to improving AI experiences, we can expect significant advancements in these areas. Overall, Amazon's integration of generative AI into Alexa and Fire TV demonstrates their commitment to providing users with more intuitive, personalized, and conversational experiences.Hey there! Have you heard about Mark Zuckerberg's latest philanthropy project? It's got a pretty ambitious goal - to "cure all diseases".

So here's the plan: CZI is planning to build one of the biggest GPU clusters in the world specifically for AI-driven biomedical research. They want to use large language models to dive deep into disease development at the cellular level and even predict how cells behave. And to do that, they're going to need some serious computational power - over 1,000 Nvidia's H100 GPUs! This high-performance computing system is expected to be up and running by 2024. And let me tell you, it's going to revolutionize biomedical research. From mapping out various cell types across different organisms to designing potential drugs and therapeutics, this GPU cluster will supercharge the entire process. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty excited to see what kind of breakthroughs this project will bring. Who knows, maybe we'll be living in a world where diseases are a thing of the past sooner than we think!So, let's dive into the latest AI updates from OpenAI, Microsoft, YouTube, Google, Cisco, and Anthropic. It seems like ChatGPT is back in the spotlight with an increase in usage, particularly because students are returning to school and concerns about AI cheating are on the rise. After experiencing a decline throughout the summer, ChatGPT has seen a 12% traffic increase since fall classes resumed in the US. However, it's important to note that current usage is still below the peak levels seen earlier this year. With students back in the classroom, concerns about AI-aided cheating have resurfaced. The easier access students have to AI technology raises fresh debates among schools about whether to ban, incorporate, or ignore such tools. For educators, managing responsible AI use in academics is becoming a complex balancing act. There's also some uncertainty surrounding potential revenue as ChatGPT's reliance on students could pose challenges for monetization. Moving on to other AI news, Microsoft has announced a new AI-powered feature called Microsoft Copilot.

**Dream Screen**: It allows users to create image or video backgrounds using AI. All you need to do is type what you want to see in the background and AI will create it for you.

**Creator Music**: This was a previously available feature but got an AI revamp this time around. Creators can simply type in the kind and length of the music they need and AI will find the most relevant suggestions for their needs.

**AI Insights for Creators:** This is an inspiration tool which generates video ideas based on AI’s analysis of what the audiences are already watching and prefer.Why does this matter?It seems like a strategic decision to natively introduce AI features to support users. It’s a trend we are seeing increasingly more across the landscape. For the users, it's great news since they get free AI assistance in their creative endeavors.

# Google’s innovative approach to train smaller language models

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled new capabilities in few-shot learning, but their massive size makes deployment challenging. To address this, the authors propose a new method called distilling step-by-step, which trains smaller task-specific models using less data while surpassing LLM performance.First, the key idea is to extract rationales - intermediate reasoning steps - from an LLM using few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. These rationales are then used alongside labels to train smaller models in a multi-task framework, with tasks for label prediction and rationale generation. Experiments across NLI, QA, and math datasets show this approach reduces training data needs by 75-80% compared to standard fine-tuning.Why does this matter?This new approach to train smaller models with higher accuracy has the potential to support language models that can be deployed on local devices while retaining the performance that was previously achievable only through LLMs.

# 4 Crucial Factors for Evaluating Large Language Models in Industry Applications

Based on your end goal, you might fancy one LLM over the other. For instance, some industries value privacy over anything while others might put data accuracy over everything else. In this article, Skanda Vivek shares the 4 critical factors you should always consider when picking a large language model.He mentions Quality, Economic, Latency, and Privacy to be the 4 resting pillars of your decision. He then goes into details discussing each of these parameters and how you should evaluate a given model against them.Why does this matter?The ability to make the right decision when choosing the underlying LLM for your applications is massively important. This article will provide you with valuable insights when it comes to choosing the right LLM.

# OpenAI unveils DALL·E 3

DALL·E 3 is built natively on ChatGPT, which lets you use ChatGPT to generate tailored, detailed prompts for DALL·E 3. If it’s not quite right, you can ask ChatGPT to make tweaks.

Even with the same prompt, DALL·E 3 delivers significant improvements over DALL·E 2, as shown below (Left: DALL·E 2 results, Right: DALL·E 3). The prompt: “An expressive oil painting of a basketball player dunking, depicted as an explosion of a nebula.”

OpenAI has taken steps to limit DALL·E 3’s ability to generate violent, adult, or hateful content.DALL·E 3 is designed to decline requests that ask for an image in the style of a living artist. Creators can also opt their images out from training of OpenAI’s future image generation models.

DALL·E 3 is now in research preview and will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in October via the API and in Labs later this fall.Why does this matter?As OpenAI notes, modern text-to-image systems have a tendency to ignore words or descriptions, forcing users to learn prompt engineering. DALL·E 3 represents a leap forward in AI’s ability to generate images that exactly adhere to the text you provide. Will other image generators like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion keep up?

&#x200B;

# DALL-E 3 will be available in Bing chat

# Amazon brings Generative AI to Alexa and Fire TV

At its annual devices event, Amazon announced a few AI updates:It will soon use a new generative AI model to power improved experiences across its Echo family of devices. The new model is specifically optimized for voice and will take into account body language as well as a person’s eye contact and gestures for more powerful conversational experiences.It also introduced generative AI updates for its Fire TV voice search, which promises to bring more conversational ways to interact with Alexa and discover new content based on specifics.Why does this matter?Integrating LLMs with voice assistants is a perfect use case. But Amazon's generative AI revamp for Alexa marks a game-changer. It promises voice assistants that understand context better, carry over information from previous conversations, and become more personalized for users.

# Amazon is turning Alexa into a hands-free ChatGPT

Amazon is upgrading Alexa, its voice assistant, with the technology behind chatbots for more complex and open-ended conversation capabilities.The new feature, which is still in progress, will show more simulated personality, interpret body language with devices equipped with cameras and modulate its voice for a more natural conversation.While this advancement holds promise, challenges like responding to body language and the fact that these large language models can sometimes blur out inappropriate or nonsensical things, remains to refine.ChatGPT Usage is Rising Again as Students Return to School

# Zuckerberg's philanthropy project is building a massive GPU cluster to ‘cure all diseases

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), founded by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, plans to build one of the world's largest GPU clusters for AI-driven biomedical research.The CZI aims to use large language models to understand disease development at cellular levels and predict cell behaviors, necessitating over 1,000 Nvidia's H100 GPUs for computational requirements.The high-performance computing system, expected to be operational in 2024, will accelerate biomedical research, from mapping varied cell types in different organisms to designing potential drugs and therapeutics.

# After declining over the summer, ChatGPT usage has increased, most likely as a result of students returning to class and concerns about AI cheating.

12% Traffic Increase Last Week: ChatGPT saw a sizable jump in US web traffic as fall classes resumed.Big Drop Over Summer Break: Traffic declined steadily from May through August when school was out.Still Below Early 2022 Peaks: But current usage remains below ChatGPT's peak levels earlier this year. Back to School Brings Old ProblemsCheating Fears Resurface: Easier student access with school back raises fresh concerns about AI-aided cheating.Schools Still Debating Rules: Many institutions continue deciding whether to ban, incorporate or ignore the technology.Potential Revenue Uncertainty: Reliance on students could be problematic for monetizing ChatGPT.With the new school year boosting ChatGPT traffic, managing responsible AI use in academics remains a complex balancing act for educators.

# DeepMind’s new AI can predict genetic diseases

Google DeepMind’s new system, called AlphaMissense, can tell if the letters in the DNA will produce the correct shape. If not, it is listed as potentially disease-causing.AlphaMissense can predict the likelihood of genetic diseases by analyzing genetic mutations called missense variants.AlphaMissense operates like a large language model, trained on human and primate biology, capable of identifying normal sequences of proteins and detecting changes that could suggest a disease.With 90% accuracy, AlphaMissense is more reliable than existing tools, potentially accelerating the process of identifying disease-causing genetic mutations, which previously required months of meticulous research.

Currently, genetic disease hunters have fairly limited knowledge of which areas of human DNA can lead to disease and have to search across billions of chemical building blocks that make up DNA. They have classified 0.1% of letter changes, or mutations, as either benign or disease-causing. DeepMind's new model pushed that percentage up to 89%.Why does this matter?AI is changing nearly everything we do at the moment and might revolutionize molecular biology and life sciences, too. This development is expected to speed up diagnosis and help search for better genetic disease treatments.

# Google is turning its Bard AI chatbot into a personal assistant

  
Google's Bard AI now has enhanced capabilities, pulling real-time data from Google's other applications and a user's data silo to deliver more relevant chatbot responses.  
A new feature named Bard Extensions allows the AI to access user's personal Google data to provide specific answers about their daily activities, while promising not to be used for ad targeting or training the AI model.  
To increase transparency and accuracy, Google is introducing a 'Double Check' feature where Bard audits its responses and highlights contradictory or heavily referenced statements.

&#x200B;

# DeepMind’s New AI Can Predict Genetic Diseases

AlphaMissense, a new model from Google’s artificial intelligence team, analyzes the effects of DNA mutations and will accelerate research into rare diseases.  
About 10 years ago, Žiga Avsec was a PhD physics student who found himself taking a crash course in genomics via a university module on machine learning. He was soon working in a lab that studied rare diseases, on a project aiming to pin down the exact genetic mutation that caused an unusual mitochondrial disease.  
This was, Avsec says, a “needle in a haystack” problem. There were millions of potential culprits lurking in the genetic code—DNA mutations that could wreak havoc on a person’s biology. Of particular interest were so-called missense variants: single-letter changes to genetic code that result in a different amino acid being made within a protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and proteins are the building blocks of everything else in the body, so even small changes can have large and far-reaching effects.

And for Windows users, you'll get to enjoy this feature sooner than you think. The free Windows 11 update will begin on September 26th. Now, you might be wondering, why is this such a big deal? The answer lies in the democratization of AI. While we don't have any mind-blowing use cases for Copilot just yet, this step forward by Microsoft is significant. As more users get their hands on this AI copilot, we'll start to see its true capabilities. And if all goes well, Microsoft could dominate an even larger share of the AI market by delivering AI natively.YouTube just announced some exciting news for creators! They're rolling out three new AI-powered features for YouTube Shorts creators. Let me break it down for you. First up, we have Dream Screen. This feature lets you create image or video backgrounds using AI. All you have to do is type in what you want to see in the background, and AI will make it happen. How cool is that? Next, we've got Creator Music. This feature got an AI revamp, making it even better than before. Now, creators can simply type in the kind and length of the music they need, and AI will find the most relevant suggestions. It's like having your own personal music assistant. Last but not least, we have AI Insights for Creators. This is a tool that generates video ideas for creators based on AI's analysis of what audiences are already watching and preferring. So, if you're looking for some inspiration, AI has got your back. This move by YouTube seems like a smart strategic decision to integrate AI features directly into the platform.

When it comes to evaluating large language models (LLMs) for industry applications, there are four crucial factors to consider. Skanda Vivek highlights these factors, which include quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy. Each of these factors plays a significant role in determining the suitability of a particular LLM. The quality of the LLM is of utmost importance. Depending on your end goal, you may prioritize different aspects of quality, such as data accuracy, contextual understanding, or fluency. Consider what matters most to your industry and choose an LLM that aligns with those preferences. Economic factors also come into play. It's essential to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a particular LLM. Does it provide value for money? Can it fit within your organization's budget? Analyzing the economic aspects ensures you make an informed decision. Latency, or the response time of the LLM, is another vital factor. Some applications require real-time or near-instantaneous responses. Evaluating an LLM's latency helps you select the model that meets your specific timing requirements. Finally, privacy is increasingly significant for many industries. Skanda Vivek emphasizes the need to consider privacy when choosing an LLM. Depending on your industry, data security and privacy regulations may be a top priority. Ensuring the chosen model aligns with your privacy needs is crucial. Choosing the right LLM is a critical decision that can significantly impact your applications. By carefully considering these four factors—quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy—you can make an informed choice that aligns with your industry's requirements. In recent news, some universities are raising concerns about AI detection software used to catch cheating students. There are worries that students could be falsely accused of cheating when using tools like ChatGPT. As a result, some universities are opting to abandon these AI detection systems. The debate highlights the potential drawbacks and risks associated with relying entirely on AI tools for academic integrity.So, here's the thing. Some major universities have decided to ditch AI detection tools because they're worried about their accuracy. And let's face it, nobody wants to be falsely accused of cheating, right? One tool in particular, called ChatGPT, has caused quite a stir. The problem with ChatGPT is that it's gained popularity among students, and that's got educators really concerned about academic dishonesty. But it's not just about students using AI to write their essays. It's also about the tool itself misidentifying things and getting it all wrong. For example, one professor in Texas failed half of his class because of false detections by ChatGPT. Can you imagine? Talk about a nightmare scenario. And it's not just him. Other students have also been wrongly accused by anti-plagiarism software using ChatGPT. What's interesting is that even OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has abandoned their own AI text detector due to its low accuracy rate. They've even warned educators about relying too heavily on AI content detectors. And here's another thing to consider: these detection tools often get it wrong when it comes to content written by non-English writers. So, yeah, there are some serious concerns here. That's why some universities, like Vanderbilt and Northwestern, have decided to say "no thanks" to these AI detection tools. It's better to be safe than sorry, right? After all, nobody wants to unfairly accuse a student of cheating.Hey there! Some interesting news for you today. According to Climate Action Against Disinformation, X, which we all know as Twitter, has ranked last when it comes to tackling climate misinformation. Quite the bummer, right? It turns out that Pinterest is leading the pack in addressing climate change misinformation, with YouTube, Meta (formerly known as Facebook), and Instagram not too far behind. But poor old X is lagging behind. So, what led to this low ranking for X? Well, it seems that since Elon Musk took over, things have changed, and not for the better. There are unclear policies on climate misinformation and a less communicative content moderation team, both of which have contributed to X's downward slide in the rankings. Maybe they need to step up their game a bit. In another news story, Google is facing a lawsuit after it allegedly directed a man, Philip Paxson, to drive off a collapsed bridge via Google Maps. Sadly, Paxson lost his life in the tragic accident. According to his family, Google was aware of the bridge's collapse but failed to update its navigation system, which they argue makes the tech giant negligent in Paxson's death. Google apparently received reports about the bridge's condition, but did nothing to fix the route information. It's a heartbreaking situation. And finally, brace yourself for this one. A study by dappGambl has found that a whopping 95% of NFTs are now practically worthless. Yep, you heard that right. NFTs, which were once all the rage, have lost their shine. Prices have plummeted, and most of the 73,257 NFT collections analyzed have a market cap of zero Ether. It's uncertain what the future holds for NFTs, but they'll need to prove their worth, whether through cultural significance or as a representation of actual art, if they want to stick around. So, that's the latest in tech and climate news. Stay tuned for more updates!OpenAI has just unveiled their latest model for text-to-image translation called DALL·E 3, and it's pretty impressive! This new version is built directly on ChatGPT, which means you can use ChatGPT to generate customized and detailed prompts for DALL·E 3. And if the results aren't exactly what you were hoping for, you can even ask ChatGPT to make some tweaks. Compared to its predecessor, DALL·E 2, DALL·E 3 delivers significant improvements in creating detailed images. OpenAI showcased this by providing a prompt for an expressive oil painting of a basketball player dunking, depicted as an explosion of a nebula. The results from DALL·E 3 were far superior to those from DALL·E 2. OpenAI has also taken steps to ensure that DALL·E 3 doesn't generate violent, adult, or hateful content. They have designed it to decline requests for images in the style of living artists. Additionally, creators have the option to exclude their images from being used in the training of OpenAI's future image generation models, giving them more control over the use of their work. Currently, DALL·E 3 is in research preview and will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in October through the API. It will later be made available in Labs for those interested. This new release is important because it addresses the limitations of previous text-to-image systems, which often ignored certain words or descriptions. With DALL·E 3, AI's ability to generate images that align precisely with the provided text takes a huge leap forward. It raises questions about how other image generators like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion will keep up. OpenAI has also prioritized safety improvements in DALL·E 3. They have implemented measures to prevent explicit content and have tools in place to identify risky words and block public figures. Furthermore, artists can now request that their work be blocked from AI copying, and DALL·E 3 won't mimic the styles of specific artists when named. OpenAI hopes that the integration with ChatGPT and the safety guards in DALL·E 3 will expand access to this technology while preventing misuse. However, there are still concerns and legal issues surrounding AI-generated art that need to be addressed.Amazon had some exciting announcements at its recent devices event. One of the standout updates is the integration of generative AI into their Echo family of devices.

# Google’s innovative approach to train smaller language models

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled new capabilities in few-shot learning, but their massive size makes deployment challenging. To address this, the authors propose a new method called distilling step-by-step, which trains smaller task-specific models using less data while surpassing LLM performance.First, the key idea is to extract rationales - intermediate reasoning steps - from an LLM using few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. These rationales are then used alongside labels to train smaller models in a multi-task framework, with tasks for label prediction and rationale generation. Experiments across NLI, QA, and math datasets show this approach reduces training data needs by 75-80% compared to standard fine-tuning.Why does this matter?This new approach to train smaller models with higher accuracy has the potential to support language models that can be deployed on local devices while retaining the performance that was previously achievable only through LLMs.

# 4 Crucial Factors for Evaluating Large Language Models in Industry Applications

Based on your end goal, you might fancy one LLM over the other. For instance, some industries value privacy over anything while others might put data accuracy over everything else. In this article, Skanda Vivek shares the 4 critical factors you should always consider when picking a large language model.He mentions Quality, Economic, Latency, and Privacy to be the 4 resting pillars of your decision. He then goes into details discussing each of these parameters and how you should evaluate a given model against them.Why does this matter?The ability to make the right decision when choosing the underlying LLM for your applications is massively important. This article will provide you with valuable insights when it comes to choosing the right LLM.

# DeepMind’s new AI can predict genetic diseases

Google DeepMind’s new system, called AlphaMissense, can tell if the letters in the DNA will produce the correct shape. If not, it is listed as potentially disease-causing.AlphaMissense can predict the likelihood of genetic diseases by analyzing genetic mutations called missense variants.AlphaMissense operates like a large language model, trained on human and primate biology, capable of identifying normal sequences of proteins and detecting changes that could suggest a disease.With 90% accuracy, AlphaMissense is more reliable than existing tools, potentially accelerating the process of identifying disease-causing genetic mutations, which previously required months of meticulous research.

Currently, genetic disease hunters have fairly limited knowledge of which areas of human DNA can lead to disease and have to search across billions of chemical building blocks that make up DNA. They have classified 0.1% of letter changes, or mutations, as either benign or disease-causing. DeepMind's new model pushed that percentage up to 89%.Why does this matter?AI is changing nearly everything we do at the moment and might revolutionize molecular biology and life sciences, too. This development is expected to speed up diagnosis and help search for better genetic disease treatments.

# Google is turning its Bard AI chatbot into a personal assistant

  
Google's Bard AI now has enhanced capabilities, pulling real-time data from Google's other applications and a user's data silo to deliver more relevant chatbot responses.  
A new feature named Bard Extensions allows the AI to access user's personal Google data to provide specific answers about their daily activities, while promising not to be used for ad targeting or training the AI model.  
To increase transparency and accuracy, Google is introducing a 'Double Check' feature where Bard audits its responses and highlights contradictory or heavily referenced statements.

&#x200B;

# DeepMind’s New AI Can Predict Genetic Diseases

AlphaMissense, a new model from Google’s artificial intelligence team, analyzes the effects of DNA mutations and will accelerate research into rare diseases.  
About 10 years ago, Žiga Avsec was a PhD physics student who found himself taking a crash course in genomics via a university module on machine learning. He was soon working in a lab that studied rare diseases, on a project aiming to pin down the exact genetic mutation that caused an unusual mitochondrial disease.  
This was, Avsec says, a “needle in a haystack” problem. There were millions of potential culprits lurking in the genetic code—DNA mutations that could wreak havoc on a person’s biology. Of particular interest were so-called missense variants: single-letter changes to genetic code that result in a different amino acid being made within a protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and proteins are the building blocks of everything else in the body, so even small changes can have large and far-reaching effects.

When it comes to evaluating large language models (LLMs) for industry applications, there are four crucial factors to consider. Skanda Vivek highlights these factors, which include quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy. Each of these factors plays a significant role in determining the suitability of a particular LLM. The quality of the LLM is of utmost importance. Depending on your end goal, you may prioritize different aspects of quality, such as data accuracy, contextual understanding, or fluency. Consider what matters most to your industry and choose an LLM that aligns with those preferences. Economic factors also come into play. It's essential to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a particular LLM. Does it provide value for money? Can it fit within your organization's budget? Analyzing the economic aspects ensures you make an informed decision. Latency, or the response time of the LLM, is another vital factor. Some applications require real-time or near-instantaneous responses. Evaluating an LLM's latency helps you select the model that meets your specific timing requirements. Finally, privacy is increasingly significant for many industries. Skanda Vivek emphasizes the need to consider privacy when choosing an LLM. Depending on your industry, data security and privacy regulations may be a top priority. Ensuring the chosen model aligns with your privacy needs is crucial. Choosing the right LLM is a critical decision that can significantly impact your applications. By carefully considering these four factors—quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy—you can make an informed choice that aligns with your industry's requirements. In recent news, some universities are raising concerns about AI detection software used to catch cheating students. There are worries that students could be falsely accused of cheating when using tools like ChatGPT. As a result, some universities are opting to abandon these AI detection systems. The debate highlights the potential drawbacks and risks associated with relying entirely on AI tools for academic integrity.So, here's the thing. Some major universities have decided to ditch AI detection tools because they're worried about their accuracy. And let's face it, nobody wants to be falsely accused of cheating, right? One tool in particular, called ChatGPT, has caused quite a stir. The problem with ChatGPT is that it's gained popularity among students, and that's got educators really concerned about academic dishonesty. But it's not just about students using AI to write their essays. It's also about the tool itself misidentifying things and getting it all wrong. For example, one professor in Texas failed half of his class because of false detections by ChatGPT. Can you imagine? Talk about a nightmare scenario. And it's not just him. Other students have also been wrongly accused by anti-plagiarism software using ChatGPT. What's interesting is that even OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has abandoned their own AI text detector due to its low accuracy rate. They've even warned educators about relying too heavily on AI content detectors. And here's another thing to consider: these detection tools often get it wrong when it comes to content written by non-English writers. So, yeah, there are some serious concerns here. That's why some universities, like Vanderbilt and Northwestern, have decided to say "no thanks" to these AI detection tools. It's better to be safe than sorry, right? After all, nobody wants to unfairly accuse a student of cheating.Hey there! Some interesting news for you today. According to Climate Action Against Disinformation, X, which we all know as Twitter, has ranked last when it comes to tackling climate misinformation. Quite the bummer, right? It turns out that Pinterest is leading the pack in addressing climate change misinformation, with YouTube, Meta (formerly known as Facebook), and Instagram not too far behind. But poor old X is lagging behind. So, what led to this low ranking for X? Well, it seems that since Elon Musk took over, things have changed, and not for the better. There are unclear policies on climate misinformation and a less communicative content moderation team, both of which have contributed to X's downward slide in the rankings. Maybe they need to step up their game a bit. In another news story, Google is facing a lawsuit after it allegedly directed a man, Philip Paxson, to drive off a collapsed bridge via Google Maps. Sadly, Paxson lost his life in the tragic accident. According to his family, Google was aware of the bridge's collapse but failed to update its navigation system, which they argue makes the tech giant negligent in Paxson's death. Google apparently received reports about the bridge's condition, but did nothing to fix the route information. It's a heartbreaking situation. And finally, brace yourself for this one. A study by dappGambl has found that a whopping 95% of NFTs are now practically worthless. Yep, you heard that right. NFTs, which were once all the rage, have lost their shine. Prices have plummeted, and most of the 73,257 NFT collections analyzed have a market cap of zero Ether. It's uncertain what the future holds for NFTs, but they'll need to prove their worth, whether through cultural significance or as a representation of actual art, if they want to stick around. So, that's the latest in tech and climate news. Stay tuned for more updates!OpenAI has just unveiled their latest model for text-to-image translation called DALL·E 3, and it's pretty impressive! This new version is built directly on ChatGPT, which means you can use ChatGPT to generate customized and detailed prompts for DALL·E 3. And if the results aren't exactly what you were hoping for, you can even ask ChatGPT to make some tweaks. Compared to its predecessor, DALL·E 2, DALL·E 3 delivers significant improvements in creating detailed images. OpenAI showcased this by providing a prompt for an expressive oil painting of a basketball player dunking, depicted as an explosion of a nebula. The results from DALL·E 3 were far superior to those from DALL·E 2. OpenAI has also taken steps to ensure that DALL·E 3 doesn't generate violent, adult, or hateful content. They have designed it to decline requests for images in the style of living artists. Additionally, creators have the option to exclude their images from being used in the training of OpenAI's future image generation models, giving them more control over the use of their work. Currently, DALL·E 3 is in research preview and will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in October through the API. It will later be made available in Labs for those interested. This new release is important because it addresses the limitations of previous text-to-image systems, which often ignored certain words or descriptions. With DALL·E 3, AI's ability to generate images that align precisely with the provided text takes a huge leap forward. It raises questions about how other image generators like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion will keep up. OpenAI has also prioritized safety improvements in DALL·E 3. They have implemented measures to prevent explicit content and have tools in place to identify risky words and block public figures. Furthermore, artists can now request that their work be blocked from AI copying, and DALL·E 3 won't mimic the styles of specific artists when named. OpenAI hopes that the integration with ChatGPT and the safety guards in DALL·E 3 will expand access to this technology while preventing misuse. However, there are still concerns and legal issues surrounding AI-generated art that need to be addressed.Amazon had some exciting announcements at its recent devices event. One of the standout updates is the integration of generative AI into their Echo family of devices. This new AI model is optimized for voice, taking into account not only what is said but also body language, eye contact, and gestures. This means that interactions with Alexa will become much more powerful and conversational, providing users with improved experiences. But that's not all. Amazon has also introduced generative AI updates for Fire TV's voice search. This update aims to enhance the conversational interaction between users and Alexa, allowing for a more natural and intuitive way to discover new content based on specific preferences. This development is significant because it showcases how integrating language models like Generative AI into voice assistants can revolutionize the way we interact with them. Amazon's revamp of Alexa using generative AI is a game-changer.

# Google’s innovative approach to train smaller language models

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled new capabilities in few-shot learning, but their massive size makes deployment challenging. To address this, the authors propose a new method called distilling step-by-step, which trains smaller task-specific models using less data while surpassing LLM performance.First, the key idea is to extract rationales - intermediate reasoning steps - from an LLM using few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. These rationales are then used alongside labels to train smaller models in a multi-task framework, with tasks for label prediction and rationale generation. Experiments across NLI, QA, and math datasets show this approach reduces training data needs by 75-80% compared to standard fine-tuning.Why does this matter?This new approach to train smaller models with higher accuracy has the potential to support language models that can be deployed on local devices while retaining the performance that was previously achievable only through LLMs.

# 4 Crucial Factors for Evaluating Large Language Models in Industry Applications

Based on your end goal, you might fancy one LLM over the other. For instance, some industries value privacy over anything while others might put data accuracy over everything else. In this article, Skanda Vivek shares the 4 critical factors you should always consider when picking a large language model.He mentions Quality, Economic, Latency, and Privacy to be the 4 resting pillars of your decision. He then goes into details discussing each of these parameters and how you should evaluate a given model against them.Why does this matter?The ability to make the right decision when choosing the underlying LLM for your applications is massively important. This article will provide you with valuable insights when it comes to choosing the right LLM.

# Intel’s ‘AI PC’ can run generative AI chatbots directly on laptops

Intel’s new chip, due in December, will be able to run a generative AI chatbot on a laptop rather than having to tap into cloud data centers for computing power. It is made possible by new AI data-crunching features built into Intel's forthcoming "Meteor Lake" laptop chip and from new software tools the company is releasing.Intel also demonstrated laptops that could generate a song in the style of Taylor Swift and answer questions in a conversational style, all while disconnected from the Internet. Moreover, Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant will be able to run on Intel-based PCs.Why does this matter?This will let businesses test ChatGPT-style AI models without sending sensitive data off their own computers. Intel seems to be on track to become the lead chip manufacturer again, competing with Nvidia to make powerful chips that train AI systems such as ChatGPT and Stability AI’s models.

# DeepMind’s new AI can predict genetic diseases

Google DeepMind’s new system, called AlphaMissense, can tell if the letters in the DNA will produce the correct shape. If not, it is listed as potentially disease-causing.AlphaMissense can predict the likelihood of genetic diseases by analyzing genetic mutations called missense variants.AlphaMissense operates like a large language model, trained on human and primate biology, capable of identifying normal sequences of proteins and detecting changes that could suggest a disease.With 90% accuracy, AlphaMissense is more reliable than existing tools, potentially accelerating the process of identifying disease-causing genetic mutations, which previously required months of meticulous research.

Currently, genetic disease hunters have fairly limited knowledge of which areas of human DNA can lead to disease and have to search across billions of chemical building blocks that make up DNA. They have classified 0.1% of letter changes, or mutations, as either benign or disease-causing. DeepMind's new model pushed that percentage up to 89%.Why does this matter?AI is changing nearly everything we do at the moment and might revolutionize molecular biology and life sciences, too. This development is expected to speed up diagnosis and help search for better genetic disease treatments.

# Google is turning its Bard AI chatbot into a personal assistant

  
Google's Bard AI now has enhanced capabilities, pulling real-time data from Google's other applications and a user's data silo to deliver more relevant chatbot responses.  
A new feature named Bard Extensions allows the AI to access user's personal Google data to provide specific answers about their daily activities, while promising not to be used for ad targeting or training the AI model.  
To increase transparency and accuracy, Google is introducing a 'Double Check' feature where Bard audits its responses and highlights contradictory or heavily referenced statements.

# DeepMind’s New AI Can Predict Genetic Diseases

AlphaMissense, a new model from Google’s artificial intelligence team, analyzes the effects of DNA mutations and will accelerate research into rare diseases.  
About 10 years ago, Žiga Avsec was a PhD physics student who found himself taking a crash course in genomics via a university module on machine learning. He was soon working in a lab that studied rare diseases, on a project aiming to pin down the exact genetic mutation that caused an unusual mitochondrial disease.  
This was, Avsec says, a “needle in a haystack” problem. There were millions of potential culprits lurking in the genetic code—DNA mutations that could wreak havoc on a person’s biology. Of particular interest were so-called missense variants: single-letter changes to genetic code that result in a different amino acid being made within a protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and proteins are the building blocks of everything else in the body, so even small changes can have large and far-reaching effects.

It's accessible both via an app and through a simple right-click, making it convenient for users to tap into its AI-powered goodness. But when can we start using Copilot? Well, the good news is that it's just around the corner. Microsoft plans to roll out Copilot this fall, making it available across Bing, Edge, and Microsoft 365. And for Windows users, you'll get to enjoy this feature sooner than you think. The free Windows 11 update will begin on September 26th. Now, you might be wondering, why is this such a big deal? The answer lies in the democratization of AI. While we don't have any mind-blowing use cases for Copilot just yet, this step forward by Microsoft is significant. As more users get their hands on this AI copilot, we'll start to see its true capabilities. And if all goes well, Microsoft could dominate an even larger share of the AI market by delivering AI natively.YouTube just announced some exciting news for creators! They're rolling out three new AI-powered features for YouTube Shorts creators. Let me break it down for you. First up, we have Dream Screen. This feature lets you create image or video backgrounds using AI. All you have to do is type in what you want to see in the background, and AI will make it happen. How cool is that? Next, we've got Creator Music. This feature got an AI revamp, making it even better than before. Now, creators can simply type in the kind and length of the music they need, and AI will find the most relevant suggestions. It's like having your own personal music assistant. Last but not least, we have AI Insights for Creators. This is a tool that generates video ideas for creators based on AI's analysis of what audiences are already watching and preferring. So, if you're looking for some inspiration, AI has got your back. This move by YouTube seems like a smart strategic decision to integrate AI features directly into the platform.

When it comes to evaluating large language models (LLMs) for industry applications, there are four crucial factors to consider. Skanda Vivek highlights these factors, which include quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy. Each of these factors plays a significant role in determining the suitability of a particular LLM. The quality of the LLM is of utmost importance. Depending on your end goal, you may prioritize different aspects of quality, such as data accuracy, contextual understanding, or fluency. Consider what matters most to your industry and choose an LLM that aligns with those preferences. Economic factors also come into play. It's essential to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a particular LLM. Does it provide value for money? Can it fit within your organization's budget? Analyzing the economic aspects ensures you make an informed decision. Latency, or the response time of the LLM, is another vital factor. Some applications require real-time or near-instantaneous responses. Evaluating an LLM's latency helps you select the model that meets your specific timing requirements. Finally, privacy is increasingly significant for many industries. Skanda Vivek emphasizes the need to consider privacy when choosing an LLM. Depending on your industry, data security and privacy regulations may be a top priority. Ensuring the chosen model aligns with your privacy needs is crucial. Choosing the right LLM is a critical decision that can significantly impact your applications. By carefully considering these four factors—quality, economic aspects, latency, and privacy—you can make an informed choice that aligns with your industry's requirements. In recent news, some universities are raising concerns about AI detection software used to catch cheating students. There are worries that students could be falsely accused of cheating when using tools like ChatGPT. As a result, some universities are opting to abandon these AI detection systems. The debate highlights the potential drawbacks and risks associated with relying entirely on AI tools for academic integrity.So, here's the thing. Some major universities have decided to ditch AI detection tools because they're worried about their accuracy. And let's face it, nobody wants to be falsely accused of cheating, right? One tool in particular, called ChatGPT, has caused quite a stir. The problem with ChatGPT is that it's gained popularity among students, and that's got educators really concerned about academic dishonesty. But it's not just about students using AI to write their essays. It's also about the tool itself misidentifying things and getting it all wrong. For example, one professor in Texas failed half of his class because of false detections by ChatGPT. Can you imagine? Talk about a nightmare scenario. And it's not just him. Other students have also been wrongly accused by anti-plagiarism software using ChatGPT. What's interesting is that even OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has abandoned their own AI text detector due to its low accuracy rate. They've even warned educators about relying too heavily on AI content detectors. And here's another thing to consider: these detection tools often get it wrong when it comes to content written by non-English writers. So, yeah, there are some serious concerns here. That's why some universities, like Vanderbilt and Northwestern, have decided to say "no thanks" to these AI detection tools. It's better to be safe than sorry, right? After all, nobody wants to unfairly accuse a student of cheating.Hey there! Some interesting news for you today. According to Climate Action Against Disinformation, X, which we all know as Twitter, has ranked last when it comes to tackling climate misinformation. Quite the bummer, right? It turns out that Pinterest is leading the pack in addressing climate change misinformation, with YouTube, Meta (formerly known as Facebook), and Instagram not too far behind. But poor old X is lagging behind. So, what led to this low ranking for X? Well, it seems that since Elon Musk took over, things have changed, and not for the better. There are unclear policies on climate misinformation and a less communicative content moderation team, both of which have contributed to X's downward slide in the rankings. Maybe they need to step up their game a bit. In another news story, Google is facing a lawsuit after it allegedly directed a man, Philip Paxson, to drive off a collapsed bridge via Google Maps. Sadly, Paxson lost his life in the tragic accident. According to his family, Google was aware of the bridge's collapse but failed to update its navigation system, which they argue makes the tech giant negligent in Paxson's death. Google apparently received reports about the bridge's condition, but did nothing to fix the route information. It's a heartbreaking situation. And finally, brace yourself for this one. A study by dappGambl has found that a whopping 95% of NFTs are now practically worthless. Yep, you heard that right. NFTs, which were once all the rage, have lost their shine. Prices have plummeted, and most of the 73,257 NFT collections analyzed have a market cap of zero Ether. It's uncertain what the future holds for NFTs, but they'll need to prove their worth, whether through cultural significance or as a representation of actual art, if they want to stick around. So, that's the latest in tech and climate news. Stay tuned for more updates!OpenAI has just unveiled their latest model for text-to-image translation called DALL·E 3, and it's pretty impressive! This new version is built directly on ChatGPT, which means you can use ChatGPT to generate customized and detailed prompts for DALL·E 3. And if the results aren't exactly what you were hoping for, you can even ask ChatGPT to make some tweaks. Compared to its predecessor, DALL·E 2, DALL·E 3 delivers significant improvements in creating detailed images. OpenAI showcased this by providing a prompt for an expressive oil painting of a basketball player dunking, depicted as an explosion of a nebula. The results from DALL·E 3 were far superior to those from DALL·E 2. OpenAI has also taken steps to ensure that DALL·E 3 doesn't generate violent, adult, or hateful content. They have designed it to decline requests for images in the style of living artists. Additionally, creators have the option to exclude their images from being used in the training of OpenAI's future image generation models, giving them more control over the use of their work. Currently, DALL·E 3 is in research preview and will be available to ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise customers in October through the API. It will later be made available in Labs for those interested. This new release is important because it addresses the limitations of previous text-to-image systems, which often ignored certain words or descriptions. With DALL·E 3, AI's ability to generate images that align precisely with the provided text takes a huge leap forward. It raises questions about how other image generators like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion will keep up. OpenAI has also prioritized safety improvements in DALL·E 3. They have implemented measures to prevent explicit content and have tools in place to identify risky words and block public figures. Furthermore, artists can now request that their work be blocked from AI copying, and DALL·E 3 won't mimic the styles of specific artists when named. OpenAI hopes that the integration with ChatGPT and the safety guards in DALL·E 3 will expand access to this technology while preventing misuse. However, there are still concerns and legal issues surrounding AI-generated art that need to be addressed.Amazon had some exciting announcements at its recent devices event. One of the standout updates is the integration of generative AI into their Echo family of devices. This new AI model is optimized for voice, taking into account not only what is said but also body language, eye contact, and gestures. This means that interactions with Alexa will become much more powerful and conversational, providing users with improved experiences. But that's not all. Amazon has also introduced generative AI updates for Fire TV's voice search. This update aims to enhance the conversational interaction between users and Alexa, allowing for a more natural and intuitive way to discover new content based on specific preferences. This development is significant because it showcases how integrating language models like Generative AI into voice assistants can revolutionize the way we interact with them. Amazon's revamp of Alexa using generative AI is a game-changer. It enables voice assistants to better understand context, seamlessly carry over information from previous conversations, and provide a more personalized experience for users. In fact, Amazon is transforming Alexa into a hands-free ChatGPT by leveraging the technology behind chatbots. This upgrade will give Alexa the ability to engage in more complex and open-ended conversations. It will also enhance its simulated personality, interpret body language (for devices with cameras), and modulate its voice for a more natural conversation. However, there are some challenges to overcome, such as responding accurately to body language and refining these large language models to prevent inappropriate or nonsensical responses. But with Amazon's dedication to improving AI experiences, we can expect significant advancements in these areas. Overall, Amazon's integration of generative AI into Alexa and Fire TV demonstrates their commitment to providing users with more intuitive, personalized, and conversational experiences.Hey there! Have you heard about Mark Zuckerberg's latest philanthropy project? It's got a pretty ambitious goal - to "cure all diseases". The project, called the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), is a collaborative effort between Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. So here's the plan: CZI is planning to build one of the biggest GPU clusters in the world specifically for AI-driven biomedical research. They want to use large language models to dive deep into disease development at the cellular level and even predict how cells behave. And to do that, they're going to need some serious computational power - over 1,000 Nvidia's H100 GPUs! This high-performance computing system is expected to be up and running by 2024. And let me tell you, it's going to revolutionize biomedical research. From mapping out various cell types across different organisms to designing potential drugs and therapeutics, this GPU cluster will supercharge the entire process. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty excited to see what kind of breakthroughs this project will bring. Who knows, maybe we'll be living in a world where diseases are a thing of the past sooner than we think!So, let's dive into the latest AI updates from OpenAI, Microsoft, YouTube, Google, Cisco, and Anthropic. It seems like ChatGPT is back in the spotlight with an increase in usage, particularly because students are returning to school and concerns about AI cheating are on the rise. After experiencing a decline throughout the summer, ChatGPT has seen a 12% traffic increase since fall classes resumed in the US. However, it's important to note that current usage is still below the peak levels seen earlier this year. With students back in the classroom, concerns about AI-aided cheating have resurfaced. The easier access students have to AI technology raises fresh debates among schools about whether to ban, incorporate, or ignore such tools. For educators, managing responsible AI use in academics is becoming a complex balancing act. There's also some uncertainty surrounding potential revenue as ChatGPT's reliance on students could pose challenges for monetization. Moving on to other AI news, Microsoft has announced a new AI-powered feature called Microsoft Copilot.

This exciting feature will be rolled out for enterprise users in October, opening up new possibilities for visual communication. Now, let's switch gears to a significant acquisition. Cisco has announced its plan to acquire cybersecurity firm Splunk for $28 billion. This move aligns with Cisco's goal to expand its software and AI-powered data analysis capabilities. Splunk, which introduced AI features earlier this year to detect and respond to data anomalies, will play a vital role in Cisco's strategy. In the realm of responsible AI scaling, Anthropic, the company behind the Claude chatbot, has released a policy that emphasizes its commitment to responsible AI system development. The policy acknowledges the potential for AI systems to cause catastrophic risks, including thousands of deaths or immense financial damage. It's encouraging to see companies prioritizing responsible AI practices. In other tech news on September 22nd, 2023, Cisco is set to make its largest acquisition ever by acquiring Splunk for $28 billion. This move aims to boost security services and system performance troubleshooting. On a different note, NASA eagerly awaits the return of pristine asteroid Bennu samples, taken by OSIRIS-REx in 2020. The samples could unlock valuable insights into the origins of our solar system. In the legal world, lawyers who sued Tesla's board for excessive pay are seeking a jaw-dropping $10,000 an hour. The case is sure to attract attention as it unfolds. Another interesting development involves an anonymous developer who used OpenAI's ChatGPT API to program an AI that created and launched an ERC-20 token called AstroPepeX.

Title: GPT-4 outperforms its rivals in new AI benchmark suite GPT-Fathom
Content: ByteDance and the University of Illinois researchers have developed an improved benchmark suite with consistent parameters, called GPT-Fathom, that indicates GPT-4, the engine behind the paid version of ChatGPT, significantly outperforms leading LLMs, including its biggest competitor, Claude 2.

For the latest advancements in AI, [look here first](https://www.superchargedai.co/subscribe?utm_campaign=campaign&utm_medium=gpt-4-benchmarking&utm_source=reddit).

**GPT-Fathom's breakthrough**

- The new benchmark suite, GPT-Fathom, addresses consistent settings issues and prompt sensitivity, attempting to reduce inconsistencies in LLM evaluation.
- In a comparison using GPT-Fathom, GPT-4 outperformed over ten leading LLMs, crushing the competition in most benchmarks, and showing significant performance leaps from GPT-3 to its successors.

**Performance specifics**

- The gap in performance was especially pronounced against Claude 2, ChatGPT's biggest rival.
- GPT-4's Advanced Data Analysis model exhibited superior performance in coding, giving it an edge as compared to LuckLlama 2, the current best-performing open-source model.
- Llama 2-70B showed comparable or better performance than gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 in safety and comprehension but displayed worse performance in "Mathematics", "Coding", and "Multilingualism".

**The seesaw effect**

- The research team noted a 'seesaw effect' where an improvement in one area can lead to degradation in another.
- For instance, GPT-4 saw a performance drop on the Mathematical Geometry Simple Math (MGSM) benchmark, despite improving its performance significantly on text comprehension benchmark DROP.

Title: JAILBREAK IDENTIFIED: GPT-4’s Multilingual Vulnerabilities Unveiled
Content: Saw a research paper that revealed critical safety gaps in GPT-4. Translating unsafe text into lesser-known languages tricks the AI into generating harmful content.

It was published two days ago, blew my mind, so I wrote an article about it, link at the end if you want to read the full thing, but you don’t have to click any links, I’ve summarised it for you:

📊 Key Findings:

	•	GPT-4’s safety falters in other languages.
	•	Unequal language training poses global risks.
	•	Translation tools expose vulnerabilities.
	•	Multilingual AI safety is a must.

This is a wake-up call for AI security.

Title: Combatting AI Misuse: Artists Utilize Data Poisoning to Their Advantage
Content: A novel tool, Nightshade, has emerged as a formidable weapon in the battle against AI misuse. This innovative tool empowers artists to introduce subtle imperceptible changes to their creations. When subjected to AI algorithms, these alterations result in unpredictable and disruptive outcomes. Nightshade primarily focuses on thwarting AI companies that exploit artists' creations for training their models, effectively "poisoning" the data.

**Unveiling the Nightshade Tool**

- Nightshade has been crafted by artists with the aim of challenging AI giants such as OpenAI, Meta, and Google, who are alleged to misuse their copyrighted works.
- This tool subtly alters the pixels in images, rendering changes imperceptible to the human eye but sufficient to disrupt machine-learning models.
- Nightshade, along with another tool named Glaze, which aids artists in concealing their distinctive style from AI tools, is poised to join forces, offering comprehensive protection.

**Methodology and Impacts of Nightshade**

- Nightshade exploits a vulnerability in AI models that rely on extensive datasets, resulting in AI models malfunctioning when manipulated images are introduced as input.
- Tests have demonstrated that a mere handful of adulterated images can significantly disrupt the output of AI models. However, inflicting substantial harm on larger models necessitates a substantial number of manipulated samples.

**Shifting the Tide Against Copyright Violations**

- Nightshade represents a significant step toward reclaiming artists' rights, as it will be open source, facilitating widespread usage and modifications.
- In addition to serving as a deterrent against copyright infringements, Nightshade instills artists with confidence by affording them greater control over their creative works.

Title: In A Shocking Twist, Research Shows That Corporate Involvement In AI Is Actually Potentially Harmful & Has A Lot of Downsides!
Content: This summary was written by Bing Chat, please do not beat the AI models with the nerf bat due to this, our benevolent corporate overlords.   


The article that is available on Arxiv is titled, ‘Analyzing the Impact of Companies on AI Research Based on Publications’. It was published in the journal Scientometrics in October 2023 by Michael Färber and Lazaros Tampakis1. It is an interesting and insightful paper that examines how companies influence AI research based on their publishing activities.  
  
The paper compares academic- and company-authored AI publications published in the last decade and uses scientometric data from multiple scholarly databases to look for differences across these groups and to disclose the top contributing organizations. The paper finds that while the majority of publications is still produced by academia, publications with company participation receive significantly more citations and online attention. The paper also provides recommendations to safeguard a harmonious balance between academia and industry in the realm of AI research.  
  
The paper cites some negative implications for corporate research vs purely academic research when it comes to AI, such as:  
  
\- The risk of losing academic freedom and integrity, as companies may have vested interests or agendas that influence the direction and outcome of AI research.  
\- The risk of creating a knowledge gap and a power imbalance, as companies may have more resources and access to data than academia, giving them an unfair advantage in AI research.  
\- The risk of neglecting ethical and social issues, as companies may prioritize profit and innovation over the welfare and rights of humans and other stakeholders affected by AI.  


To address these issues, the paper suggests several strategies, such as:  
  
\- Promoting fair access and collaboration, by creating platforms and incentives that facilitate data sharing, joint projects, and peer review between academia and industry.  
\- Maintaining academic freedom and integrity, by establishing clear guidelines and policies that regulate the involvement and influence of companies in AI research.  
\- Addressing ethical and social issues, by involving diverse perspectives and stakeholders in the design, development, and evaluation of AI systems.

Title: How powerful are you on the scale of: 1 billion company kicks you out with no shares, President of the company resigns out of loyalty, senior AI researchers follow the resignations & then the rival board asks you to come back?
Content: Full article: https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo

The OpenAI board is in discussions with Sam Altman to return to CEO, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. One of them said Altman, who was suddenly fired by the board on Friday with no notice, is “ambivalent” about coming back and would want significant governance changes.

Altman holding talks with the company just a day after he was ousted indicates that OpenAI is in a state of free-fall without him. Hours after he was axed, Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president and former board chairman, resigned, and the two have been talking to friends and investors about starting another company. A string of senior researchers also resigned on Friday, and people close to OpenAI say more departures are in the works.

Title: Hundreds of OpenAI employees threaten to resign and join Microsoft
Content: Most of the staff at OpenAI have threatened to resign from the company and join Microsoft, which has hired ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman to lead a new “advanced AI research team.” In a letter to OpenAI’s board that was reported on this morning by Wired and journalist Kara Swisher, more than 500 current OpenAI staffers say that “Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join.”

The letter says the OpenAI employees will leave if the board does not reinstate Altman and Brockman and then resign. But seeing as the board has already made its choice, deciding to remain in place and naming a new CEO, while Altman and Brockman head to Microsoft, it seems that Microsoft may have just found Altman’s first several hundred employees, assuming they’re correct about the company’s promise to hire them all.  
  
OpenAI employees signing the letter accuse the company’s board of jeopardizing their work and having “undermined our mission and company.” They also reject the idea that OpenAI was pushing ahead too quickly without concern for safety. “Our work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms,” they write.

In a post on OpenAI’s official blog, the company writes that Altman’s departure follows a “deliberative review process by the board” that concluded that Altman “wasn’t consistently candid in his communications” with other board members — “hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.”

Title: How powerful are you on the scale of: 1 billion company kicks you out with no shares, President of the company resigns out of loyalty, senior AI researchers follow the resignations & then the rival board asks you to come back?
Content: Full article: https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo

The OpenAI board is in discussions with Sam Altman to return to CEO, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. One of them said Altman, who was suddenly fired by the board on Friday with no notice, is “ambivalent” about coming back and would want significant governance changes.

Altman holding talks with the company just a day after he was ousted indicates that OpenAI is in a state of free-fall without him. Hours after he was axed, Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president and former board chairman, resigned, and the two have been talking to friends and investors about starting another company. A string of senior researchers also resigned on Friday, and people close to OpenAI say more departures are in the works.

Title: Hundreds of OpenAI employees threaten to resign and join Microsoft
Content: Most of the staff at OpenAI have threatened to resign from the company and join Microsoft, which has hired ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman to lead a new “advanced AI research team.” In a letter to OpenAI’s board that was reported on this morning by Wired and journalist Kara Swisher, more than 500 current OpenAI staffers say that “Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join.”

The letter says the OpenAI employees will leave if the board does not reinstate Altman and Brockman and then resign. But seeing as the board has already made its choice, deciding to remain in place and naming a new CEO, while Altman and Brockman head to Microsoft, it seems that Microsoft may have just found Altman’s first several hundred employees, assuming they’re correct about the company’s promise to hire them all.  
  
OpenAI employees signing the letter accuse the company’s board of jeopardizing their work and having “undermined our mission and company.” They also reject the idea that OpenAI was pushing ahead too quickly without concern for safety. “Our work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms,” they write.
