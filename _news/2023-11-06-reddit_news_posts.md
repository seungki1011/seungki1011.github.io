## [3] "In A Shocking Twist, Research Shows That Corporate Involvement In AI Is Actually Potentially Harmful & Has A Lot of Downsides!"
This summary was written by Bing Chat, please do not beat the AI models with the nerf bat due to this, our benevolent corporate overlords.   


The article that is available on Arxiv is titled, ‘Analyzing the Impact of Companies on AI Research Based on Publications’. It was published in the journal Scientometrics in October 2023 by Michael Färber and Lazaros Tampakis1. It is an interesting and insightful paper that examines how companies influence AI research based on their publishing activities.  
  
The paper compares academic- and company-authored AI publications published in the last decade and uses scientometric data from multiple scholarly databases to look for differences across these groups and to disclose the top contributing organizations. The paper finds that while the majority of publications is still produced by academia, publications with company participation receive significantly more citations and online attention. The paper also provides recommendations to safeguard a harmonious balance between academia and industry in the realm of AI research.  
  
The paper cites some negative implications for corporate research vs purely academic research when it comes to AI, such as:  
  
\- The risk of losing academic freedom and integrity, as companies may have vested interests or agendas that influence the direction and outcome of AI research.  
\- The risk of creating a knowledge gap and a power imbalance, as companies may have more resources and access to data than academia, giving them an unfair advantage in AI research.  
\- The risk of neglecting ethical and social issues, as companies may prioritize profit and innovation over the welfare and rights of humans and other stakeholders affected by AI.  


To address these issues, the paper suggests several strategies, such as:  
  
\- Promoting fair access and collaboration, by creating platforms and incentives that facilitate data sharing, joint projects, and peer review between academia and industry.  
\- Maintaining academic freedom and integrity, by establishing clear guidelines and policies that regulate the involvement and influence of companies in AI research.  
\- Addressing ethical and social issues, by involving diverse perspectives and stakeholders in the design, development, and evaluation of AI systems.  


I hope this summary gives you an overview of the article. If you want to read the full text, you can find it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20444).
