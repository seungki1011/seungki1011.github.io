In a post on OpenAI‚Äôs official blog, the company writes that Altman‚Äôs departure follows a ‚Äúdeliberative review process by the board‚Äù that concluded that Altman ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt consistently candid in his communications‚Äù with other board members ‚Äî ‚Äúhindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.‚Äù

## [2] "How powerful are you on the scale of: 1 billion company kicks you out with no shares, President of the company resigns out of loyalty, senior AI researchers follow the resignations & then the rival board asks you to come back?"
Full article: https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo

The OpenAI board is in discussions with Sam Altman to return to CEO, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. One of them said Altman, who was suddenly fired by the board on Friday with no notice, is ‚Äúambivalent‚Äù about coming back and would want significant governance changes.

Altman holding talks with the company just a day after he was ousted indicates that OpenAI is in a state of free-fall without him. Hours after he was axed, Greg Brockman, OpenAI‚Äôs president and former board chairman, resigned, and the two have been talking to friends and investors about starting another company. A string of senior researchers also resigned on Friday, and people close to OpenAI say more departures are in the works.

## [4] "Hundreds of OpenAI employees threaten to resign and join Microsoft"
Most of the staff at OpenAI have threatened to resign from the company and join Microsoft, which has hired ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman to lead a new ‚Äúadvanced AI research team.‚Äù In a letter to OpenAI‚Äôs board that was reported on this morning by Wired and journalist Kara Swisher, more than 500 current OpenAI staffers say that ‚ÄúMicrosoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join.‚Äù

The letter says the OpenAI employees will leave if the board does not reinstate Altman and Brockman and then resign. But seeing as the board has already made its choice, deciding to remain in place and naming a new CEO, while Altman and Brockman head to Microsoft, it seems that Microsoft may have just found Altman‚Äôs first several hundred employees, assuming they‚Äôre correct about the company‚Äôs promise to hire them all.  
  
OpenAI employees signing the letter accuse the company‚Äôs board of jeopardizing their work and having ‚Äúundermined our mission and company.‚Äù They also reject the idea that OpenAI was pushing ahead too quickly without concern for safety. ‚ÄúOur work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms,‚Äù they write.
