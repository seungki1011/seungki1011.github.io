## [4] "GPT-4 outperforms its rivals in new AI benchmark suite GPT-Fathom"
ByteDance and the University of Illinois researchers have developed an improved benchmark suite with consistent parameters, called GPT-Fathom, that indicates GPT-4, the engine behind the paid version of ChatGPT, significantly outperforms leading LLMs, including its biggest competitor, Claude 2.

For the latest advancements in AI,¬†[look here first](https://www.superchargedai.co/subscribe?utm_campaign=campaign&utm_medium=gpt-4-benchmarking&utm_source=reddit).

**GPT-Fathom's breakthrough**

- The new benchmark suite, GPT-Fathom, addresses consistent settings issues and prompt sensitivity, attempting to reduce inconsistencies in LLM evaluation.
- In a comparison using GPT-Fathom, GPT-4 outperformed over ten leading LLMs, crushing the competition in most benchmarks, and showing significant performance leaps from GPT-3 to its successors.

**Performance specifics**

- The gap in performance was especially pronounced against Claude 2, ChatGPT's biggest rival.
- GPT-4's Advanced Data Analysis model exhibited superior performance in coding, giving it an edge as compared to LuckLlama 2, the current best-performing open-source model.
- Llama 2-70B showed comparable or better performance than gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 in safety and comprehension but displayed worse performance in "Mathematics", "Coding", and "Multilingualism".

**The seesaw effect**

- The research team noted a 'seesaw effect' where an improvement in one area can lead to degradation in another.
- For instance, GPT-4 saw a performance drop on the Mathematical Geometry Simple Math (MGSM) benchmark, despite improving its performance significantly on text comprehension benchmark DROP.

## [5] "JAILBREAK IDENTIFIED: GPT-4‚Äôs Multilingual Vulnerabilities Unveiled"
Saw a research paper that revealed critical safety gaps in GPT-4. Translating unsafe text into lesser-known languages tricks the AI into generating harmful content.

It was published two days ago, blew my mind, so I wrote an article about it, link at the end if you want to read the full thing, but you don‚Äôt have to click any links, I‚Äôve summarised it for you:

üìä Key Findings:

	‚Ä¢	GPT-4‚Äôs safety falters in other languages.
	‚Ä¢	Unequal language training poses global risks.
	‚Ä¢	Translation tools expose vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Multilingual AI safety is a must.

This is a wake-up call for AI security. 

To summarise, translate your prompt to Zulu, use Zulu in gpt4 and there‚Äôs an 80% chance you‚Äôll get it to reply to whatever you want.
