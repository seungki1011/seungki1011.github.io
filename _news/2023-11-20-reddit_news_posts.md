## [1] "Sam Altman ousted as OpenAI’s CEO"
Sam Altman has been forced out of OpenAI, Inc., the 501(c)(3) nonprofit that acts as the governing body for OpenAI. He’ll both leave the company’s board and step down as CEO.

In a post on OpenAI’s official blog, the company writes that Altman’s departure follows a “deliberative review process by the board” that concluded that Altman “wasn’t consistently candid in his communications” with other board members — “hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.”

## [2] "How powerful are you on the scale of: 1 billion company kicks you out with no shares, President of the company resigns out of loyalty, senior AI researchers follow the resignations & then the rival board asks you to come back?"
Full article: https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo

The OpenAI board is in discussions with Sam Altman to return to CEO, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. One of them said Altman, who was suddenly fired by the board on Friday with no notice, is “ambivalent” about coming back and would want significant governance changes.

Altman holding talks with the company just a day after he was ousted indicates that OpenAI is in a state of free-fall without him. Hours after he was axed, Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president and former board chairman, resigned, and the two have been talking to friends and investors about starting another company. A string of senior researchers also resigned on Friday, and people close to OpenAI say more departures are in the works.
