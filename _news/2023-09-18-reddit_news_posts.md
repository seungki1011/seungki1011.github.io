## [1] "AI models can now predict how a US judge will rule with 86% accuracy — without even considering the facts of the case."
Datapoints include where the judge went to law school, what their net worth is, how they rule when the lawyers are from big law firms versus boutique practices and the judges' history in public law, private practice and state judgeships.

If you can predict how the judge will rule 86% of the time without the facts of the case, primarily based on demographic information, what does that say about the US justice system?

## [2] "The Caribbean Island making $30 Million from AI Domains"
The Caribbean island of Anguilla is witnessing an unexpected surge in revenue due to its ".ai" internet domain. Assigned the “ai” code by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Anguilla has seen a significant increase in demand for ".ai" domains in recent years, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence technology.

  
[Recent data](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-31/ai-startups-create-digital-demand-for-anguilla-s-website-domain-name)from Anguilla's ".ai" domain management indicates that domain registrations have doubled in the past year. Several tech companies, including major corporations such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, have shown interest in securing ".ai" domains, potentially due to the influence of AI developments like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

  
In 2021, Anguilla reportedly earned $7.4 million from ".ai" domain registrations, as per public records. Initial projections for 2023 had placed expected revenue at $8.3 million, but revised estimates now suggest that the island could earn between $25 million to $30 million this year. This revenue represents a significant portion of the island's GDP.

  
The rising demand for ".ai" domains has provided Anguilla with an unforeseen financial opportunity. The prominence of AI technology and its applications appear to have elevated the importance and value of the ".ai" domain.

## [3] "It’s time to regulate AI like cars and drugs, top Microsoft exec says"

Microsoft wants federal licenses for any AI powerful enough to be a public safety risk, the company’s president said in an interview on POLITICO Tech.

With Congress in a flurry of hearings on AI this week, Smith is among the tech leaders expected at a closed-door session with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday, along with Elon Musk of Tesla, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Satya Nadella, also from Microsoft.

## [4] "Meta plans to match OpenAI's GPT-4 with its new AI model"
Citing  GPT-4 as the benchmark, Meta is reportedly gearing up to train a new, highly sophisticated AI model. The company is investing heavily in AI training chips and boosting its data centers to support the ambitious project.

To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, [look here first.](https://supercharged-ai.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=meta-gpt4&utm_campaign=campaign)

**Meta’s vision for its new AI model**

- Meta's aim is to create a powerful chatbot in line with OpenAI’s GPT-4 capabilities.
- The company has reportedly been in pursuit of Nvidia H100 AI-training chips and is amplifying its infrastructure.
- The idea is to independently train its new model without outsourcing to platforms like Microsoft's Azure.

**Efforts and roadblocks**

- Meta plans to begin the training of this LLM early in 2024, emphasizing free access for companies.
- Despite its grand vision, Meta has encountered obstacles like researcher attrition and contentious resource allocation amidst multiple LLM projects.
- Noteworthy is the intense competition from major players such as Apple, Google, and Amazon to integrate widely generative AI in their user interface.

**Broader implications**

- While OpenAI has not immediately revealed plans for a GPT-5, other tech giants are investing heavily. Apple's investment in its "Ajax" AI model signifies the increasing race to advanced AI.
- This move by Meta represents the ongoing trend of tech conglomerates expanding in the AI space, a fact revealed through Google and Microsoft’s use of AI in their productivity tools and Amazon's ongoing developments.

## [5] "Microsoft and Google's staggering water consumption rates for AI"
AI, with its vast resource needs, is raising concerns over sustainability and environmental impact. Last year, Microsoft's data centers drained over 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water, reflecting a 34% increase from the previous year. Google also reported a 20% water consumption increase over the same period.

To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, [look here first.](https://supercharged-ai.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=ai-water&utm_campaign=campaign)

**A deeper look at AI's water footprint**

- The growth of AI and related technologies increases the need for vast server farms, which depend heavily on water for cooling purposes.
- The spike in water usage can be attributed primarily to AI, as per Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the UC, Riverside, who focuses on AI's environmental impact.
- For every 5 to 50 prompts submitted to ChatGPT, it consumes about 500 ml of water, according to an upcoming paper from Professor Ren's team.

**Big Tech and responsible water usage**

- Recognizing their significant water consumption, tech companies like Google have voiced concerns and are exploring ways to mitigate the negative effects.
- Google has committed to responsible water usage, which includes assessing where and how their water usage might affect surrounding areas.
