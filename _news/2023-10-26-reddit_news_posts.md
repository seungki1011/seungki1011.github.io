## [3] "Qualcomm's New Chips Excel at AI Processing, Boast 4.5x Faster Performance than Rivals"
Qualcomm has unveiled two powerful processors optimized specifically for GenAI applications. 4.5 times faster than competitors, the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 come with enhanced image generation capabilities, text processing, and on-device security features.

To stay up to date on AI developments, [look here first.](https://www.superchargedai.co/subscribe?utm_campaign=campaign&utm_medium=qualcomm-chip&utm_source=reddit)

**AI-centric Optimizations**

- Qualcomm has geared these processors to ace GenAI models, outperforming the competition by 4.5 times on INT4 AI benchmark tests.
- The chips can handle GenAI models with 13 billion parameters (X Elite) and 10 billion parameters (8 Gen 3), ensuring robust on-device processing capabilities.

**On-device Security**

- Qualcomm's on-device AI processing protects users' queries and results, enhancing security and privacy.
- On-device processing limits potential risks tied to biometric and personal data upload to cloud-based AI.

**Implications and Prospective Applications**

- The ability to run AI directly on devices could transform a range of tasks, including meeting/document summarization, email drafting, code/music generation, and photo editing.
- By integrating AI features directly on the device, users can enjoy better personalization, faster processing, and improved device interaction.
- Qualcomm is planning iterations of these chips with greater parameters to support more sophisticated AI models, such as those for ADAS systems.

## [4] "Two-minute Daily AI Update (Date: 10/23/2023): News from Meta, NVIDIA, OpenAI, IBM, Oracle, YouTube, and Instagram"
Continuing with the exercise of sharing an easily digestible and smaller version of the main updates of the day in the world of AI.  


* **Meta introduces Habitat 3.0, a leap towards socially intelligent robots**  
\- Meta claims it is the highest-quality simulator that supports both robots and humanoid avatars and allows for human-robot collaboration in home-like environments. AI agents trained with Habitat 3.0 learn to find and collaborate with human partners at everyday tasks like cleaning up a house, thus improving their human partner’s efficiency.  
\- Meta also announced Habitat Synthetic Scenes Dataset and HomeRobot– in all, three major advancements in the development of socially embodied AI agents that can cooperate with and assist humans in daily tasks.
* **NVIDIA’s research breakthrough, Eureka, puts a new spin on robot learning**  
\- A new AI agent that can teach robots complex skills has trained a robotic hand to perform rapid pen-spinning tricks for the first time, as well as a human can. The robots have learned to expertly accomplish nearly 30 tasks thanks to Eureka, which autonomously writes reward algorithms to train bots.
* **OpenAI reveals DALL-E 3's secret sauce of accurate prompt generation**  
\- OpenAI has published a paper on DALL-E 3, showing how the system follows prompts more accurately than other systems by using better image labels.
* **IBM is developing a brain-inspired chip for faster, more energy-efficient AI**  
\- New research out of IBM Research’s lab, nearly two decades in the making, has the potential to drastically shift how we can efficiently scale up powerful AI hardware systems. The new type of digital AI chip for neural inference is called NorthPole.
* **Oracle loops in Nvidia AI for end-to-end model development**  
\- Oracle is bringing Nvidia AI stack to its marketplace to simplify AI development and deployment for its customers. It gives Oracle customers access to the most sought-after, top-of-the-line GPUs for training foundation models and building generative applications.
* **YouTube is developing an AI tool to help creators sound like famous musicians**  
\- In beta, the tool will let a select pool of artists give permission to a select group of creators to use their voices in videos on the platform. Negotiations with major labels are ongoing and slowing down the project's beta release.
* **There’s now an AI cancer survivor calculator**  
\- Researchers have created an AI-based tool to predict a cancer patient's odds of long-term survival after a fresh diagnosis. It was found to accurately predict cancer survival length for three types of cancers.
