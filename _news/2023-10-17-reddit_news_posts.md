## [2] "New Algorithm Developed to Improve the Long-Term Memory of LLM's"
I release this algorithm under an MIT Open-Source license. The full repository is available on my GitHub. It is 100% based on the scientific discoveries in the study that was published on October 6th titled, 'New Theory Challenges Classical View on Brain's Memory Storage'.   
  
Why do I keep releasing these? It is not to profit from them, I would not release them under an MIT license if so. I am honestly straight up picking and choosing what I think is the most groundbreaking research in these areas as it is released and ensuring that no one can ever copyright anything around it as it relates to AI. Plain and simple. If someone does not like that, they are more than welcome to research and iterate on these things faster than me. We are dealing with a field of research where we all learn something new every day.
