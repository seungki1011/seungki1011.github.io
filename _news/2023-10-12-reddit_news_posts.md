## [3] "New Algorithm Developed to Improve the Long-Term Memory of LLM's"
I release this algorithm under an MIT Open-Source license. The full repository is available on my GitHub. It is 100% based on the scientific discoveries in the study that was published on October 6th titled, 'New Theory Challenges Classical View on Brain's Memory Storage'.   
  
Why do I keep releasing these? It is not to profit from them, I would not release them under an MIT license if so. I am honestly straight up picking and choosing what I think is the most groundbreaking research in these areas as it is released and ensuring that no one can ever copyright anything around it as it relates to AI. Plain and simple. If someone does not like that, they are more than welcome to research and iterate on these things faster than me. We are dealing with a field of research where we all learn something new every day.

## [5] "JAILBREAK IDENTIFIED: GPT-4â€™s Multilingual Vulnerabilities Unveiled"
Saw a research paper that revealed critical safety gaps in GPT-4. Translating unsafe text into lesser-known languages tricks the AI into generating harmful content.

It was published two days ago, blew my mind, so I wrote an article about it, link at the end if you want to read the full thing, but you donâ€™t have to click any links, Iâ€™ve summarised it for you:

ðŸ“Š Key Findings:

	â€¢	GPT-4â€™s safety falters in other languages.
	â€¢	Unequal language training poses global risks.
	â€¢	Translation tools expose vulnerabilities.
	â€¢	Multilingual AI safety is a must.

This is a wake-up call for AI security. 

To summarise, translate your prompt to Zulu, use Zulu in gpt4 and thereâ€™s an 80% chance youâ€™ll get it to reply to whatever you want.
