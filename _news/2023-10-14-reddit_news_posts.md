## [2] "New Algorithm Developed to Improve the Long-Term Memory of LLM's"
I release this algorithm under an MIT Open-Source license. The full repository is available on my GitHub. It is 100% based on the scientific discoveries in the study that was published on October 6th titled, 'New Theory Challenges Classical View on Brain's Memory Storage'.   
  
Why do I keep releasing these? It is not to profit from them, I would not release them under an MIT license if so. I am honestly straight up picking and choosing what I think is the most groundbreaking research in these areas as it is released and ensuring that no one can ever copyright anything around it as it relates to AI. Plain and simple. If someone does not like that, they are more than welcome to research and iterate on these things faster than me. We are dealing with a field of research where we all learn something new every day.

* **LLM Lie Detector catches AI lies**  
\- New research discusses how LLMs can "lie" by outputting false statements even when they know the truth. The authors propose a simple lie detector that does not require access to the LLM's internal workings or knowledge of the truth. It works by asking unrelated follow-up questions after a suspected lie and using the LLM's yes/no answers to train a logistic regression classifier.  
\- The lie detector is highly accurate and can generalize to different LLM architectures, fine-tuned LLMs, sycophantic lies, and real-life scenarios.
* **Stability.ai introduces Stable LM 3B for portable smart devices**

On math, logic, and language tasks, Promptbreeder outperforms other state-of-the-art prompting techniques.
* **Canva bolsters its AI toolkit with Runway**  
\- Canva is celebrating its 10th anniversary with Magic Studio, one of its biggest product launches ever but this time with AI. It includes a new generative video tool through a partnership with Runway ML.
* **Meta research’s new method for decoding speech from brain waves**   
\- It can decode speech from non-invasive brain recordings with high level of accuracy. The model was trained using contrastive learning and was able to identify speech segments from magneto-encephalography signals with up to 41% accuracy on average across participants.   
\- The model's performance allows for the decoding of words and phrases that were not included in the training set. 
* **British startup Wayve developed GAIA-1, A 9B parameter model trained on 4,700 hours of driving data**  
\- This model is for autonomous driving that uses text, image, video, and action data to create synthetic videos of various traffic situations for training purposes. It is 480 times larger than the previous version and offers incredible results.   
\- It is designed to understand and decode key driving concepts, providing fine-grained control of vehicle behavior and scene characteristics to improve autonomous driving systems.

* **Perplexity and GPT-4 with a new prompting mechanism outperform Google Search**  
\- New research by Google, OpenAI, and the University of Massachusetts presents FreshPrompt. It is a simple few-shot prompting method that substantially boosts the performance of an LLM by incorporating relevant and up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine into the prompt. Its experiments show that FreshPrompt outperforms both competing search engine-augmented prompting methods such as Self-Ask as well as commercial systems such as Perplexity.ai.
* **Microsoft to debut AI Chip**  
\- The company plans to unveil its first chip designed for AI at its annual developers’ conference next month. The move, a culmination of years of work, could help it lessen reliance on Nvidia-designed AI chips, which have been in short supply as demand for them has boomed.
