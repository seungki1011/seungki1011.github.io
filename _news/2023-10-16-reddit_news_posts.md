## [2] "New Algorithm Developed to Improve the Long-Term Memory of LLM's"
I release this algorithm under an MIT Open-Source license. The full repository is available on my GitHub. It is 100% based on the scientific discoveries in the study that was published on October 6th titled, 'New Theory Challenges Classical View on Brain's Memory Storage'.   
  
Why do I keep releasing these? It is not to profit from them, I would not release them under an MIT license if so. I am honestly straight up picking and choosing what I think is the most groundbreaking research in these areas as it is released and ensuring that no one can ever copyright anything around it as it relates to AI. Plain and simple. If someone does not like that, they are more than welcome to research and iterate on these things faster than me. We are dealing with a field of research where we all learn something new every day.

## [5] "Two-minute Daily AI Update (Date: 10/10/2023): News from Anthropic, Google Cloud, SAP, OpenAI, Mendel, Lambda Labs, and more"
Continuing with the exercise of sharing an easily digestible and smaller version of the main updates of the day in the world of AI.  


* **Anthropic’s breakthrough makes AI more understandable**  
\- It developed a new method to interpret the individual neurons inside LLMs like Claude, helping researchers better understand and decode the model’s reasoning. The method decomposes groups of neurons into simpler "features" with clearer meanings.
* **Google Cloud introduced new Vertex AI Search features for healthcare and life science companies**  
\- It will help users find relevant information over a broader spectrum of data types. Building on the tool’s current ability to search many different kinds of documents and other data sources, the new capabilities will help find accurate clinical information more efficiently.
* **SAP unveils new generative AI innovations that boost productivity and effectiveness in spend management**  
\- It announced new business AI and user experience innovations in its comprehensive spend management and business network solutions to help customers control costs, mitigate risk, and increase productivity.
* **ChatGPT’s mobile app hit record $4.58M in revenue last month, but growth is slowing**  
\- This gross revenue is across its iOS and Android apps worldwide. But while it was topping 31% in July and 39% in August, that dropped to 20% growth as of September.
* **Mendel launches AI-Copilot for real world data applications in healthcare**  
\- Called Hypercube, it enables life sciences and healthcare enterprises to interrogate their troves of patient data in natural language through a chat-like experience. It can deliver blazing-fast insights and answer previously unanswerable questions.
* **Lambda Labs, AWS’s competitor, nears $300M funding**  
\- Like AWS, it rents out servers with Nvidia chips to AI developers and is nearing a $300M equity financing. As demand for Nvidia’s AI chips has skyrocketed this year, revenue at startups such as Lambda has boomed, attracting investors.
* **AI drones successfully monitor crops to report the ideal time to harvest**  
\- For the first time, researchers have demonstrated a largely automated system that heavily uses drones and AI to improve crop yields. It carefully and accurately analyzes individual crops to assess their likely growth characteristics.
* **Scientists achieve 70% accuracy in AI-driven earthquake predictions**  
\- An AI tool predicted earthquakes with 70% accuracy a week in advance, as observed during a 7-month trial held in China. Based on its analysis, the tool successfully anticipated 14 earthquakes. This experiment was conducted by researchers from The University of Texas (UT) at Austin, USA.
