## [3] "Google is expanding its AI-powered search experience to teenagers"
Google's AI-driven search experience, Search Generative Experience (SGE), is now accessible to teenagers between 13-17 in America. Entailments include a conversational mode for searches, which Google believes can help youngsters pose atypical questions to dig deeper.

For the latest advancements in AI, [look here first](https://www.superchargedai.co/subscribe?utm_campaign=campaign&utm_medium=google-sge&utm_source=reddit).

**Teen-friendly AI search**

- SGE introduces a conversational mode to Google Search, allowing users to ask questions and follow-ups in a more natural language.
- To prevent harmful content from surfacing, Google has placed guardrails, providing stronger protections related to illegal and age-gated substances, or bullying.

**Features and improving AI accuracy**

- Google is rolling out "About this result" to provide users with more context about the displayed content.
- Google acknowledges and addresses any validation of false or offensive claims by the AI-powered response, ensuring to provide higher quality and more accurate responses.
- It’s also using large language models to self-critique and rewrite draft responses on sensitive topics based on quality and safety principles.

**SGE's popularity and future plans**

- Since SGE's introduction, it has found popularity, especially among younger users who prefer a conversational approach.
- Google plans to expand SGE outside the U.S. to India and Japan and improve its services with support for videos, images, local info, and more.
- It's also experimenting with ads positioned next to the AI-generated responses.

## [4] "Meta's Llama 2 Long outperforms GPT 3.5 and Claude 2"
Meta Platforms recently introduced Llama 2 Long, a revolutionary AI model outperforming top competitors with its ability to generate accurate responses to long user queries.

For the latest advancements in AI, [look here first](https://supercharged-ai.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=llama2long&utm_campaign=campaign).

**Meta's new AI model**

- As an enhancement of the original Llama 2, Llama 2 Long deals with larger data containing longer texts and is modified to handle lengthier information sequences.
- Its stellar performance outshines other models such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 2.

**How Llama 2 Long works**

- Meta built different versions of Llama 2, ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters, which refines its learning from data.
- Llama 2 Long employs Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) technique, refining the way it encodes the position of each token, allowing fewer data and memory to produce precise responses.
- The model further fine-tunes its performance using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and synthetic data generated by Llama 2 chat itself.

**Impressive feats and future aspirations**

- Llama 2 Long can create high-quality responses to user prompts up to 200,000 characters long, which is approximately 40 pages of text.
- Its ability to generate responses to queries on diverse topics such as history, science, literature, and sports indicates its potential to cater to complex and various user needs.
- The researchers see Llama 2 Long as a step towards broader, more adaptable AI models, and advocate for more research and dialogue to harness these models responsibly and beneficially.
